Compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to around the country and in Southeast Asia, Char's is a far cry from a true Thai dining experience. All of the usual suspects are on the menu, but fall short of my expectations. Typically, I find their veggies to be overcooked/limp, and the curries to be very thin and lacking in depth and richness. The same can be said for their soups and rice dishes - lacking flavor and not cooked well. Furthermore, when it comes to service, I've found the wait staff to be incredibly short and cold in dealing with myself and other guests (always rushing around, never taking the time to talk to you more than taking your order and scurrying off). I've been here with family friends before, who's Shrimp dish was obviously not fresh (as we all confirmed by trying a bit at our table before notifying the management) and they REFUSED to correct it in any way, charging us full price for the dish!
