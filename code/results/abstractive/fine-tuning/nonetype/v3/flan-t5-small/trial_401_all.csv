Food has been delicious and service from bartender Elliot has been top notch! Sadly, NO MORE. We don't live in the area either and make it point to visit Black Powder Tavern when we can, especially for the Toll House Pie. Though this desert has seen changes from pie slice, to individual sized pie/tart pan, and then back to pie slice it was a favorite of ours. However, whom ever is making it now, PLEASE STOP THEM. The last two visits there have been no chocolate chips in the pie, so all you are left with is a slightly under-cooked mess of tasteless dough.

Boys cooking the burgers were too busy watching and talking about a sport on their phones to realize we were standing at the counter. We were the ONLY guests inside at the time. I walk up to get a side of mayo after we got our order, the kid makes the side of mayo, sets it on the counter and continues to talk for literally three minutes while I stood there watching him and the two other employees talk about the sport they were watching AGAIN. I tried to get their attention twice before I actually succeeded and got my mayonnaise. They tried to apologize but I said it was fine because obviously their conversation was more important than the guest that was standing in front of them. I sit down, and both mine and my boyfriend's hamburger buns had blue/black mold on them. Brought it back up to the counter and the employees tried arguing with me that it wasn't mold because they just got those buns delivered today.
