Come on lady.. why not give me an application to work here if you're gonna expect me to walk to the back of this place every time I get up.. She seated me closer to the middle of the room.

I wound up having some gyoza, pepper chicken, grilled pork, string beans, and cabbage.. Everything I chose was ok..

Also with the food came pico de gallo, gaucamole and, sour cream, all of which were a welcome addition. The service was attentive. Our server kept coming back to refill coffee and soda and to make sure we had everything that we needed. Everything that passed our table looked really good and really well prepared.

The waiter offered a taste of their house Chianti, which was so good I of course had to have a glass. Between all that and the complimentary bread with olive oil and herbs, I was feeling great by the end of the night. I was skeptical of Macaroni Grill due to it being a chain and having a reputation of being unhealthy, but I think it is good in moderation, and great if you are unconcerned about healthiness. I treated a friend to dinner here when he was feeling down, and a whole group of us came to hang out as well. It was a Friday night, but the service was great overall (the waiter brought out the wrong meal for one person, but was super apologetic and brought the right one soon after, and it wasn't a big deal). We had an excellent time. I had the fried mac & cheese bite appetizer and dark chocolate gelato for a relatively small meal (most portions for entrees here are huge, as you might expect at an Italian restaurant). Both were delicious! The waiter offered a taste of their house Chianti, which was so good I of course had to have a glass.
