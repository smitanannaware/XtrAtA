The men who served me reminded me of my own family and I felt at home. It wasn't busy at all when I came in on a Monday afternoon but when I got my pho, it was so good. One thing I always pay attention to when eating pho at restaurants are the noodles. The noodles were freshly cooked and the pho broth was great, but definitely not as good as my dad's (*wink wink wink) hahaha!

I arrived around 830A on a Saturday and there were only a few people in line in front of me. Order and pay at the cash register, then seat yourself - coffee was out very quickly and food followed soon enough. I opted for my usual non fat latte and ordered the Famous Banana Kahlua French Toast - Challah bread topped with bananas sauteed in brown sugar, Kahlua and butter - OMG, Wow! Blew me away, sex in your mouth good! Many reviews mentioned this being the best french toast anyone had ever eaten therefore my hopes were set exceptionally high and I will tell you, they were not let down for a second. It's quite hard to compare it to my other most fav french toast (chocolate chip cookie chips ahoy french toast from the Griddle Cafe in LA) because they are quite different so they share the #1 spot ;)""]","[[''], [''], [''], [''], ['The restaurant is placed on the water.

We've been here both pre and post covid and have been impressed every time. The staff has always been nice and accommodating and the courtyard is the best for a romantic South Philly date night. Let's start with drinks - I always get a bottle of Montepulciano or Lambrusco. Both are great. I've ordered cocktails here a few times (typically an a Negroni or Old Fashioned) and have never been overly impressed, I'd say stick with wine. The Affettati Misti is hands down my favorite appetizer - it's enough for a group of 3 or 4 to share, or the burrata is always a good bet as well. The pasta here is so good I've honestly never bothered to order anything else for an entree. Pros: Cute courtyard, yummy homemade pasta, good wine.

Come on lady.. why not give me an application to work here if you're gonna expect me to walk to the back of this place every time I get up.. She seated me closer to the middle of the room. I asked for a glass of water, then wandered over to the buffet.... I circled the two buffet islands, the sushi table, and soup and dessert table twice, then thought... wtf am I doing here... Yeah, there's quite a bit of food here... But nothing really here that was a must have. Not even the sushi table, which I usually like at places like this... Not much really looked appetizing. I wound up having some gyoza, pepper chicken, grilled pork, string beans, and cabbage.. Everything I chose was ok.. But somehow, the fact that even my eyes weren't tricked into wanting more of what was available just made me feel like it was a waste of time being there just made me feel like it was a waste of time being there..."", ""I've been to this place a few times and it's always good.

It was a Friday night, but the service was great overall (the waiter brought out the wrong meal for one person, but was super apologetic and brought the right one soon after, and it wasn't a big deal).

Had the cucumber martini which was super refreshing and light. Also had a Acropotini, which was tasty but too sweet. The chicken gyro was delicious and big for $8.
