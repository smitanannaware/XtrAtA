We rented 2 cabanas to keep the party popping until the weeeeee hours of the morning. The Pricing was very flexible and my wedding was the 15 hour party I always dreamed of. Because we had lady gaga (chi chi Lalique) and a 7ft brides maid (Daphne Ferraro) both who are some of the best drag queens you can find.

I didn't really want anything on the menu, but I got the guacamole bacon burger. The first half was alright. No real distinct flavours, everything just kind of blending together. Once I got into the second half, I became overwhelmed with some sort of sickly sweet orange sauce on it that just made me totally nauseated. I couldn't finish it. My side caeser was fine, but hardly had any dressing on it. I don't really like Hudsons as a place to go out dancing because they play all the same Top 40/mash up crap that every other place plays. The dance floor is pretty small and it gets crowded and hot. They have a few of the good, mainstream Canadian beers available.

Hot, fresh and tasty. I did use the salt shaker, but I appreciate that they don't over salt their food. Happy hour (3-7pm everyday) includes beer, wine, sangria and martinis. Had the cucumber martini which was super refreshing and light. Also had a Acropotini, which was tasty but too sweet. The chicken gyro was delicious and big for $8. We also tried the new spicy feta spread for $7. Complimentary bread is served with tzatziki as well. Everything was delightful.

I was skeptical of Macaroni Grill due to it being a chain and having a reputation of being unhealthy, but I think it is good in moderation, and great if you are unconcerned about healthiness. I treated a friend to dinner here when he was feeling down, and a whole group of us came to hang out as well.

I had the fried mac & cheese bite appetizer and dark chocolate gelato for a relatively small meal (most portions for entrees here are huge, as you might expect at an Italian restaurant). Both were delicious! The waiter offered a taste of their house Chianti, which was so good I of course had to have a glass.
