Though I only like about 7 things in Delaware, this is still high praise. Here are the main highlights (in no particular order): 1. This is Black owned and operated business; a rarity in a state lacking diversity. 3. The salon's earth tone decor and wood floors create a classy, clean, and welcoming environment. I got a few sew-in weaves there and I loved them. I brought my own hair, and LaRee sewed it in with a net. I love nets because they last longer, don’t move around on your scalp, and look neater. Sew-ins cost $135. With all of these accolades (in no particular order), you’re probably wondering why I only gave this salon 4 stars. Well, here’s the problem: the manicurist/pedicurist turnover rate is insane! I see a different one each time I go there! The girls that worked there about a year and half ago were AMAZING.

She has taken me from platinum blonde, to creamsicle copper, to champagne blonde, to my current balayage golden blonde. With all that color you'd think my hair would be brittle and damaged but it's not because Cass is super knowledgeable, uses the best products, and offers effective deep conditioning treatments. In addition, her salon doubles as a community art space. There is always great local art on sale on the walls, the occasional yoga class where proceeds go to local community organizations, and beauty nights where you get to learn about and test products for free. I even won a jar of organic, vegan body scrub in a raffle at the last beauty night (super exciting for someone who never wins!).

I've been going to Alysha for years, and she is always great. She listens to what I want, and she cuts with precision. She doesn't use the razor much to texture my coarse, thick hair. I highly recommend Alysha! Because I have short hair, I am charged for a men's cut ($60), so it's very reasonable, in my opinion, for an exceptional salon. Also, you get 5% off if you pay with cash!
