1,"I visited Prep & Pastry for the first time this year, and I've been about one or three times, give or take. I have to say, I was never really interested whenever I looked at this place because the food was not intriguing to look at. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a go. I can't say I was pleasantly surprised but I also can't say I was disappointed. Some items were a hit, somewhat, and some items were a miss, somewhat. From memory, I had: biscuits & gravy, the dip, classic (french toast but pancake), a dole doughsant, and the brunch punch cocktail.Getting into it-Interior/Exterior: The inside is so cutely decorated! Getting to the location is a bit rough and the parking kind of sucks but you win some you lose some. 4/5Ambiance: It is always busy here! I am not complaining, despite the fact it's always buzzing with people, it never takes too long to be seated. 5/5Food: Given the price of these items, I would expect a liiiittle more seasoning. I found some of the food a bit bland, don't get me wrong, still palatable but for $14 I would've expected some more of a kick out of the dip. I ordered the classic french toast at one point but they were out and so they offered me a pancake instead. My fault, I'm not really keen on pancakes but they were alright, nonetheless. I didn't finish them though. Their pastries are amazing, no complaints! The alcohol will kick you while you're down, which I appreciate. I've personally had better biscuits and gravy and probably would not order again. 3.5/5Price: A bit overpriced, in my opinion. Maybe it's to add to the vibe but you can easily rack up a bill here for a handful of dishes and a coffee. 3/5Customer Service: All the waiters, hosts, etc are so nice! 5/5Overall: A decent place to visit with just about anyone, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. 4/5disclaimer: these are delayed reviews.",None,None,None,None,None
2,"Classic West Philly spot where you can see local wildlife. Everyone from moms to anarchists to hackers to organic gardeners to activists hangs out there. The coffee is excellent, the baked goods are great as well, and if you're working on something, you might run into a possible collaborator there.If you're thinking of moving to West Philly, definitely check out Satellite and the farmer's market.UPDATE (2/24/2013):They've replaced the cracked and chipped cups with new cups, which are awesome. They also got rid of the vegan chicken salad wrap, which was genuinely awful. Everything's looking better, but still feels like home! =)Old Review:There are some downsides to Satellite, but none that really keep us away. For one, every cup is chipped. Every. Single. Cup. I always get my coffee ""to go"" even if I plan to stay there to avoid drinking out of the cups. Avoid the ""vegan chicken salad wrap"" at all costs. Technically, it's edible. But it's really terrible, and not even close to actual chicken.The bathroom used to be gross, but now is looking a lot better. There's black chalkboard paint on the walls, which is probably for the best.The service varies widely, but has been improving lately. There's one guy who works there who is just really cold to patrons. Some servers are rude and some are really lovely. But I almost never came back after my first time there because of bad service.","local wildlife, anarchists, hackers, organic gardeners, activists",None,"local wildlife, anarchists, hackers, organic gardeners, activists",None,None
3,"Came here with my husband on our honeymoon this past week as a celebratory meal. We had seen that this was probably the fanciest place in New Orleans so we had to try it. Definitely make sure to make a reservation. First off, this place is HUGE. Literally we walked through like 5 rooms to get to our table. It was crazy. There are a few options on the menu. You can do the tasting menu, a 3 course meal, or a la carte. We both chose to go with the 3 course meal. I got a shrimp dish and my husband got the quail. For dessert I opted for the souffle. I have to say the food was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever had though for that price, but it was good nonetheless. Most notable was the souffle. It was AMAZING. Worth the extra $3 for it. I was so mad that I couldn't finish it because I was way too full. Overall, this was a good choice for a special occasion. The service is great and the atmosphere is definitely fancy. The managers also make sure to personally come by to congratulate you and thank you for eating at the restaurant which I thought was a good touch. I personally just felt a tad bit out of place here. We were definitely the only minorities at this restaurant and we definitely stood out, but it's fine.Tip: There are a ton of pokestops around here since it's right across from the cemetery. It's also a pokestop by itself too. So get your pokeballs and catch them pokemon!","pokestops, cemetery",None,"pokestops, cemetery",None,None
4,"Coming to New Orleans and not eating at Commander's Palace is like going to Paris and not visiting the Louvre. It's not just a meal but a memorable experience. WHAT WE ORDERED: the 3 course coolinary dinner, consisting of a 3 sample soup (turtle soup, gumbo du jour, and chef's seasonal soup), the black skillet seared gulf fish and the creole bread pudding souffle. We also ordered the pecan-crusted gulf fish and a glass of von hovel white wine.Out of the soups, the gumbo du jour was our favorite. The pecan-crusted gulf fish was divine. The creamy crushed-corn sauce that came with it wonderfully complimented the crunchiness of the pecan crust. The seared gulf fish was also complimented by a great, spicy, smoked tomato vinaigrette sauce. The bread pudding souffle was the most unique. It was topped with a bourbon sauce that added an extra level of sophistication to this traditional dessert.After our meal, our waiter, Todd, was kind enough to give us a tour of the estate, a perfect way to cap a perfect meal. Thanks to him we learned about the history of the restaurant as well as the craftsmanship that went into making every one of its dining rooms feel like a different setting altogether. The garden room has floor-to-ceiling panes of glass that overlook the patio, while the main dining room downstairs has hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana as well as electric chandeliers, each worth $10,000, with lights that flicker and move as if they were candle flames. Todd also gave us a tour of the red wine collection, and the cellar room that can host a private party surrounded by their extensive collection of wine bottles. One of the cellar rooms is kept locked at all times because the wine bottles in there are so old that they shouldn't be moved, and obviously expensive ($6000 / per bottle). We also got to see the adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener. Needless to say, the service was excellent. Todd really gave us a new appreciation for the restaurant and made us feel as if we were family.Another lovely detail about our meal was that all of the ingredients for the pecan-crusted gulf fish came within a 50-mile radius, while most of the ingredients that make up the dishes on the menu come within a 100-mile radius. The open kitchen, which guests are welcome to walk through, features a list of the local ingredients used in the meals. TIP: For an excellent briefing on commander's palace, ask for Todd as your waiter! For the most scenic seating, ask for a table overlooking the patio in the upstairs garden room.","tour, estate, garden room, tour, red wine collection, cellar room, extensive collection, wine bottles, adjacent garden, open kitchen",None,"tour, estate, garden room, tour, red wine collection, cellar room, extensive collection, wine bottles, adjacent garden, open kitchen",None,None
5,"The lime green counter, shiny plastic furniture, and stained concrete floors at the Fat Straw fit right in with and outdo the futuristic style of bubble tea cafes I've been to in other cities. The wall of polaroids of customers does a nice job balancing out all the geometric shapes and synthetic materials, and keeps the Fat Straw from feeling sterile. I would expect the high-end look of the Fat Straw, along with its prime location at Edgehill Village, to mean that the prices would be higher than the usual bubble tea hole in the wall, but they're actually pretty standard ($3.50 for a 16oz bubble tea). Along with the usual flavors, some more interesting possibilities that caught my eye were red bean, honeydew, lychee, pomegranate, ginger, elvis (banana + peanut butter), and sesame. The only drawbacks to the Fat Straw that I can see are the small size of the cafe (it would feel crowded with any more than 15 customers inside) and their cash only policy.",None,"lime green counter, shiny plastic furniture, stained concrete floors, polaroids, geometric shapes, synthetic materials, high-end look","lime green counter, shiny plastic furniture, stained concrete floors, polaroids, geometric shapes, synthetic materials, high-end look","* Restaurants typically focus on providing food such as dinner, beverages, good service and management including payment policies.

6,"Friends of ours recommended this new restaurant that is right next to the Charcoal Pit on 202. They said they really enjoyed their meal, so we decided to give this place a chance last Saturday. We went in for a late lunch/ early dinner around 4:45pm. There was only one other table in there, so we had the place to ourselves. This gave us a chance to walk around and check things out. The dcor is different for an Italian place. There are no paintings of Venice on the walls, thank god! Each table has a guidebook of Italy tourist spots, so you can check things out while you browse the menu. Our waitress was very welcoming and gave her recommendations. The menu is very simple, nothing fancy. We started with the fried calamari. It was very good, not chewy at all. My only complaint was that it was served on top of the marinara sauce. This caused the breading to become soggy. Ask for it on the side. For entrees we had the chicken parm and penne alla vodka. The rigatoni and penne pasta is made fresh in house. The vodka sauce was somewhat different than what I am used to. It was a lighter cream color, and didn't seem to have any prosciutto in it. Either way it was excellent. The dish also came with 3 breaded chicken cutlets. The pieces of chicken were off to the side sitting on top of their house marinara sauce. It was a little odd, having the two sauces on one plate, but the chicken was really good, so I'm not complaining. The chicken parm was basically the same cutlets I had, only bigger, with parm cheese on it. The house red sauce was good. We didn't get dessert, as the entrees are very large here. You will more than likely be taking some of it home. Our bill, including two glasses of wine ($8 each) was only $54. The prices are very fair. Hands down the best Italian on 202. I will definitely return.",guidebook,no paintings,"guidebook, no paintings",None,None
7,"This is a review of a family Thanksgiving dinner - conceived and cooked at Charro Steak. Then heated and enjoyed at home surrounded by our small family on this out of sorts Thanksgiving. The meal was wonderful. 5 stars. More if they had the option. Everything was wonderfully prepared and thoughtfully packaged with detailed, fool-proof instructions. The bird was moist, tasty, and gorgeous. The elotes and stuffing, in a coop with Barrio Bread, were delicious. The buttery smooth green Chile mashed potatoes were a hit!  And the gravy - oh the gravy was heaven.   Si Charro always impresses. And this was no exception.  You could tell the food was prepared with love.

Beautiful establishment, classy and stately.My order consisted of 2 appetizers and dessert: 1 pound of clams in a brothy-creamy sauce, grilled artichokes and the bread pudding. Clams were great, artichokes were the best I have ever had. Probably lightly steamed, then brushed with oil and grilled! Wowzer, that the chokes elevated to nirvana-like level Bread pudding was good and best described as a prelude to fall served in a cast iron skillet.Prompt and friendly service.

10,"HORRIBLE customer service, issues from the second we walked in. Boys cooking the burgers were too busy watching and talking about a sport on their phones to realize we were standing at the counter. We were the ONLY guests inside at the time. I walk up to get a side of mayo after we got our order, the kid makes the side of mayo, sets it on the counter and continues to talk for literally three minutes while I stood there watching him and the  two other employees talk about the sport they were watching AGAIN. I tried to get their attention twice before I actually succeeded and got my mayonnaise. They tried to apologize but I said it was fine because obviously their conversation was more important than the guest that was standing in front of them. I sit down, and both mine and my boyfriend's hamburger buns had blue/black mold on them. Brought it back up to the counter and the employees tried arguing with me that it wasn't mold because they just got those buns delivered today. (First of all, when deliveries are received they should be inspected and if there is mold the product needs to be set aside and labeled DO NOT USE/DO NOT DISCARD/HOLD FOR CREDIT for your supplier.) They finally gave in when another employee came up and agreed that it was mold. I manage a restaurant that gets deliveries of buns everyday, I guarantee you I know what mold looks like. Then we had to wait for the manager to come out to help us who also wasn't very helpful. No apologies from any of the employees. Thankfully we were able to get a refund but we won't be going back.

11,"I was skeptical of Macaroni Grill due to it being a chain and having a reputation of being unhealthy, but I think it is good in moderation, and great if you are unconcerned about healthiness. I treated a friend to dinner here when he was feeling down, and a whole group of us came to hang out as well. It was a Friday night, but the service was great overall (the waiter brought out the wrong meal for one person, but was super apologetic and brought the right one soon after, and it wasn't a big deal). We had an excellent time. I had the fried mac & cheese bite appetizer and dark chocolate gelato for a relatively small meal (most portions for entrees here are huge, as you might expect at an Italian restaurant). Both were delicious! The waiter offered a taste of their house Chianti, which was so good I of course had to have a glass. Between all that and the complimentary bread with olive oil and herbs, I was feeling great by the end of the night. Our whole group of 6 people very much enjoyed their food, and my friend was successfully cheered up.Definitely recommended for an American twist on Italian.

Guests can place their belongings away from the cats in the side cubicles. There were over 10 cats here to interact with. Many of them were sleeping on the big pillows on the floor when we arrived. One orange cat was particularly hissy & scratched my husband when we visited. It wasn't too bad of a scratch though. The lady who greeted us at the door was polite & cordial.

18,"We had breakfast here and it was phenomenal. Our party had egg sandwiches, scrambled eggs, toast with guava jam, pan de quesos, passion fruit juice and ginger lemonades. All very delicious! Wish we had room for more in our stomachs because the acai bowls looked delicious and there were some enticing smoothies on the menu, too. They have one of those menus that stress you out because you it's hard to choose from all of the awesome options they have.

19,"I have been wanting to venture over to Garrison since their opening and last night I finally made it!

I'm not much of a golfer but I did love that you can switch it to games like zombie dodgeball. When we ordered drinks I was even happier, my old fashioned was perfect and not overly sweet like most bars make it. The poutine was soooooo good and perfect for the for of us to split.

21,"I'm really conflicted about what to rate Urban Shabu. The menu items were extensive but as other reviewers mentioned, the portions the staff give you are very inconsistent and therefore it gets confusing when you want to order more. For instance, we ordered what we thought were several orders of the shittake mushrooms, but received literally about 5-6. We upped the ante on our next order and doubled our original order, but didn't receive ANY the next round, or the round after that. We think they ran out, but they could have at least informed us. Aside from this, I enjoyed that everyone gets their own individual hot pot and soup base. The sauce station is also extensive and I like that it's DIY. Oh, and the seat covers to keep your jackets from getting smelly is a nice touch. I probably would have rated Urban Shabu 4 or 4.5, but the one thing that REALLY turned us off from our meal was the huge cockroach we saw scampering up the wall less than 1 foot away from us about 15 minutes before we were about to leave. It was disgusting. I'm not talking about a tiny bug either, but a full size cockroach. We heard that the restaurant upstairs has (had?) infestation problems in the past, but that's certainly no excuse for Urban Shabu. It's a shame because this place was a fairly good hot pot restaurant too. That said, I'd probablyyyyyy come back (ack! I'm saying this very hesitantly).. but not before they fix some major issues: bugs and portion standardization.",None,None,None,None,None

26,"Heard about this place on DDD on Food Network and got excited to see if a place could actually make a Tamale comparable to my Mom's. I will travel anywhere for great food and a great experience and this seemed to have it all. Great food from the Mexican husband AND THEN a fusion of the styles with his in-laws as part of the business. After I posted on Facebook that I would be coming here my friends gave recommendations and prepared me for awesomeness.I even convinced my pregnant wife to travel 1+ hours down to Indianapolis, after the Indianapolis State Fair, to eat here for dinner. We got even more excited when we got there and we could tell that they had renovated and updated their look since the show had aired with bright green colors and the workers wearing matching outfits and headbands. From there it was down hill.The young, blonde, male worker rolled his eyes as came in through the door and approached the counter. Being newbies we had a tough time with the menu but got no assistance, only a blank stare wondering why we had bothered to come bother him on the weekend. Understanding that their food is really good and once it is gone.. it is gone. They even put a big screen tv up in front of the register to tell you what flavors they had remaining. I don't feel stupid because instinct has you looking at their main board for the menu offerings and everyone that came in after us made the same mistake. Yats Cajun has a similar method but they erase the menu item that they have run out of. HINT HINTBefore I could complete my order, with the young and obviously annoyed dude, part of my order was ready for payment at another register? I had not completed my order and I was being asked to pay... This caused even more confusion as we were trying to order for my wife and my 5 and 3 yrs old.I had 2 options for tamales. Chicken in green salsa and some other option. IT wasnt bad but it was not what DDD described as way more meat and filling than masa. A good tamale has enough masa to hold it together but not too much where it masks the flavor of the filling. I gave it to the kids as they didn't really mind bland and minimally flavored food. They couldn't tell the difference between the chicken chunks and the giant mound of masa I chiseled out for them. I also got 2 tacos Steak and Pork. Steak was dry and not what a steak taco should be. Saving grace was the tortilla... sad. Guacamole was stringy and old as it hangs out in plastic containers that sit in a shelf all day. Guac has to be made fresh in order for it to stand out as being good. GOOD ABOUT THE PLACEPork was very good and juicy. Tortillas are very good. Chips were amazing.This is the First time I have been disappointed in visiting a place I saw on TV. Maybe going in during the day shift or during the week instead of a Sunday in the afternoon would change that up? Maybe annoyed dude hates working the weekend? Or maybe during the day the actual folks that were on the program are there when the good reviews come in? You can obviously tell that their values are not shared by everyone on their staff including annoyed dude. Everywhere else I have gone that is featured on the show I have had a great time with. I have even gotten a chance to talk to the owners at Camp Washington in Cincinnati. This was not one of those times. Glad to say that my Mom's Tamales are still 100x better than this hyped up mess.","DDD, Food Network",None,"DDD, Food Network",None,None
27,"The big draw of this place is the excellent pizza, which you can have with beer on an outside deck with a view of parklands. It's a nice place to hang out on a sunny afternoon. You can even go for a walk in the Goose Creek Park behind the restaurant afterwards to burn off the calories you just consumed. The big minus is that if you go for lunch or in early afternoon, the menu is really limited. ""Grill"" is a misnomer - should really be called Goose Creek Pizza and Salad because that, along with a few pedestrian sandwich and appetizer choices, is all they offer before 4:30 pm. The menu had a whole page of entrees that looked tasty, but are only served after 4:30 pm. Since we were there before 4:30 pm, we didn't get to eat any, and I'm not sure I want to go back in the evening when it's probably more crowded and less fun to eat outdoors. The pizza selections are interesting - everything from bacon cheeseburger to various veggie and cheese combos - and the crust is very good, better than Uno's up the street. It would be nice if Goose Creek had a choose-your-own-toppings option as I don't think I saw one. The beer selection is OK - not a lot on tap, a few more selections in the bottle. I think Uno's up the street beats them there. This place also seems to attract a goodly number of families with kids at lunch times, probably because it serves pizza and there's a playground in the adjoining park, so be aware that you'll probably be swigging back your beer with someone's little Muffy and Joshie scampering past your table. Of course, after the second or third beer, you probably won't care.","parklands, Goose Creek Park, playground",None,"parklands, Goose Creek Park, playground",None,None

The sushi is really lacking though...There were huge inconsistencies between our first and second visits, so it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason, but I think a big part of it might be the rice.  It has a chewy texture that I really wasn't a fan of. Add baking to that rice, as some of the rolls did, and it's a gummy, chewy mess. The nigiri during our first visit had a nice rice to fish ratio, our second visit...the nigiri was huge, not the bite sized pieces it should be.  I did like the egg roll appetizer, although I think that it was more like a rolled crab Rangoon than an egg roll.  The dragon balls were tasty on our first visit (breaded and fried jalapeño coins topped with crab and a tasty sauce), but on our second visit...the jalapeños were not really cooked, the breading fell off...and the ribs and seeds hadn't been removed so the jalapeños were just raw and too spicy/hot for me to eat.Ok, now on to the children's menu.  I think it is great that they offer one, but the chicken jerky that they tried pass off as chicken strips was just atrocious.  It was so thinly sliced that when breaded and fried it became almost inedible.  My grandson gnawed on one piece for a few minutes before giving up on it altogether.  (We fed him dinner after we left) I'm bummed...I tried to like this place. I even visited it a second time since our first visit was during their first week open.

This was very nice because the ladies get to take their shoes off [: There was also a small window between our VIP area and the bar behind the wall so you could order drinks through it like a drive-thru type thing.

39,"This is such a cool place! Three words was all it took to add this gem to my list of places to visit while in St. Louis - ""Good Burger Car!!"" YES! They have the car from the movie Good Burger! A movie I was obsessed with as a child &, have since, gotten my kids to love just as much! The place is made out of cool, colorful shipping containers, with many neat decorations, what looks like an alien spaceship from Toy Story with a laser on it adorned the top of the place along with a cow. Now, on to the food. They have many different options to choose from including create-your-own burgers & many of their own creations, sandwiches, salads, sides, kid's meals, & shakes & floats. I had a single burger and added fried egg, bacon, & pepper jack. It was an amazing burger! There were some things that took a star away from what could have been a 5-star rating however. Number one, parking! This could just be a common thing in St. Louis, but parking was VERY limited. Their tiny parking lot was full, no street parking anywhere near by, & there is a parking lot behind the place that was only for residential parking, sign specifically stating not for restaurant parking or cars would be towed at owner's expense. Wasn't the best idea, but we took the chance anyway as we couldn't find any parking anywhere else, & luckily, our vehicle was not towed! I definitely do not suggest this for anyone though. Another draw back, the place is not specifically a ""drive-in"", in the common meaning of a drive-in, it did have indoor seating, however it was HOT as could be inside the building, very crowded, & extremely NOISY! Could barely even hear the cashier taking our order at the counter. There is outdoors seating, which is where we chose to eat our meal, even though it was a pretty warm day. Still felt better outside than in. The burgers we ordered were absolutely delicious, however the fries we chose to go with were not good at all. Cold & tasted overcooked. They did have a tasty seasoning on them though, & probably would have been great had they been a bit more fresh. Was definitely worth the stop however, even if just to get some photos of the Good Burger car with my children. They were so excited about this! Honestly not sure who was more excited, my sons or their father! Such a unique place & worth a visit! They also sell souvenir T-shirts & hats, & my fianc had to get himself a ""HI AF"" shirt. The shirts were heavily influenced by the movie Good Burger & there was one in particular I had my heart set on, unfortunately they did not have it in my size. Would visit here if ever in the area again, just for the sole purpose of seeing if they have the shirt I desired in my size! & to have another one of their delicious burgers, of course!","Good Burger Car, souvenir T-shirts, hats,""HI AF"" shirt",None,"Good Burger Car, souvenir T-shirts, hats,""HI AF"" shirt",None,None

41,"I like coffee shops. I study at them. I work in them. I hang out at them...way too much. I spend tons of my hard earned cash on coffee shops despite being able to brew a perfectly good cup at home. I consider myself a conniseur of the coffee shop. Bean Gallery disappoints me.Bean Gallery has terrible coffee. It's watery and lukewarm. The espresso is likewise not tasty and is expensive. The workers seem lost as to how to make a good espresso. The tea is good albeit expensive.The barista charges seem to be completely arbitrary. I don't think I ever pay the same price twice here. The cafe has many tables for studying and people turn it into a makeshift office during the day. In the morning there is a large crowd of regulars. They basically yell at each other when conversing. I've never heard people speak this loudly! One of the worst offenders has a dog that either smells terrible when he brings it inside or barks outside. The regulars usually yell to each other about local politics and news stories in the daily paper. I think it's really inappropriate. I think the regulars believe it's kitschy and cute.At night there are several tutors who meet with students on the big table. This can be a bit uncomfortable to be around and the tutors are loud. The shop features an array of used books that range from ""Basics of Mechanical Engineering"" to ""A Guide on Planetary Leadership."" The internet is so-so. It's not a bad place for study but it tends to get really loud. The morning and night regulars are pretty obnoxious about their decibel level.One of the biggest complaints I have about BG is that it's so dirty. Flthy!! It walks the line between yuppie shop and hippie shop, taking the worst of both worlds. Obnoxiousness and uncleanliness. The bathrooms scare me. I've seen worse, but these are just not acceptable for the caliber of shop this should be.The sanwhiches and food are pretty bad. They are delivered fresh daily but the quality is low. Ordering a sandwhich here made me regret not eating at one of the many other options nearby.Parking is all along the street. It's actually a little bit dangerous to avoid cars flying down Canal Street or turning down the road alongside the shop. The road by the shop is very narrow with cars parked on both sides. Cars turning from Canal are forced to speed across onto this street and go far too fast by the parked cars. Thus patrons exiting their cars in this area are in real danger of being hit. There is not a good solution to this problem other than avoiding parking on that street.I do like the mugs that are used in the coffee shop. But they are a bit dirty and do not make up for the many deficiencies. To-go cups are, as another reviewer pointed out, styrofoam. Whatever. This place has many other things it needs to address before the cups!Overall this is a usable coffeeshop but I live nearby and will drive elsewhere if I can spare the time. This shop has the bones of being a GREAT place, but it disappoints as is.","used books, Basics of Mechanical Engineering, A Guide on Planetary Leadership, internet",None,"used books, Basics of Mechanical Engineering, A Guide on Planetary Leadership, internet",None,None
42,"THE SERVICEOur first waiter Ed was awesome! If we could just review him, this would be 5-stars. He was attentive, helpful and funny. We were bummed he had to leave mid-meal (but it happens) and then it was sort of like our table was ghosted. We received our next dishes without issue but then no one followed up with us quite a while and we wanted to order desserts and get our check. The other challenge with service was pacing based on the size of our table. We were at a small high top  near the bar. First of all, there were no hooks under the table to hang a purse so we were sort of stuck with either bags on the ground or tucked behind our back. The table was small (high tops usually are) and all the plates we ordered would be brought out at once. There'd be no space on the table to move drinks. It was precarious at times. Next time, instead of ordering 3-4 plates at once, I'd do one or two at a time to prevent that from happening again. THE LOCATIONFull disclosure: I'm a MidTown/Downtown girl, so Zeppelin is a trek for me. I wish it was closer to the hustle and bustle of the heart of Reno. Their location is way out in the suburbs of South Reno so I won't be able to be a regular.There is plenty of parking so you don't need to worry about that. THE COCKTAILSI ordered The Devil's Mouth-a fruity jalapeño margarita-first. Fair warning: the spicy salt rim is SPICY. When you get a big helping of it, it's definitely a shock to the system. That said, I loved the cocktail itself which had the slightest hint/kick of jalapeño. Next time, I'd get it with out the spicy rim.The second cocktail was somewhat of my own design. I added whiskey to their Lavender Lemonade from the mocktail menu. I was hoping the lavender lemonade would be very distinctive, but it just tasted like lemonade and whiskey. I didn't dislike it at all! It just didn't blow my mind.DINNERSalma and I went wild ordering lots of shareable plates. The Tempura Green Beans were a surprise hit. They are basically green been French fries with a fancy aioli. The Short Rib tacos were a hit. Easily one of the best plates of the night.We also ordered half a dozen oysters. I'm always skeptical of oysters in Nevada, but I'm open to being surprised. Unfortunately, the oysters seems a little warm to me. They were served over ice but they just didn't have that crispness that I expect from great oysters. I've been spoiled by my time on the east coast.The rotational pizza (their weekly social) was phenomenal! We couldn't finish it so I took home leftovers for sure. The pizza was hot, cheesy and covered in toppings. I would definitely get another flatbread here. The Lamb Skewers served with their tzatziki-style sauce were like lamb meatballs. I found them to be over salted and I lost the ability to enjoy the flavors of everything else in the dish. Once again, not bad. But I think the flavors need a little refining personally.DESSERTI love the way they do dessert. You use a piece of paper and a pencil to check off what you want to order on a list. The servings are fairly small so you don't feel too indulgent. I definitely recommend the Bourbon Caramel Brownies and the Blueberry Cheesecake.WRAP UPI would come here again for sure! It's got a nice ambiance and it's not too loud. There are some great drink, dinner and dessert items. And all of the staff members we engaged with were wonderful! That said, it's three stars because it didn't blow me out of the water the way some of my other favorite places in Reno have.",None,None,None,None,None

48,"Visited here earlier for a coffee break with a few co-workers, and we really, really enjoyed it.When you walk in the door from the rear parking lot, you come off the new deck and are greeted by reclaimed wide wooden floors that we later learned used to be Al Gore's tobacco barn. Seriously.The folks from Magdalene have done a terrific job with their choices in lighting fixutres, seating, decor - across the board. I especially loved the chandeliers that are teacup collections representing a larger story you'll have to read once you visit. I totally smelled a pinterest post in my future... and if you've ever seen folks taking an old antique door and turning that into a coffee table... they've done that, too, up front in between comfy couches.I had a chai latte. It was good, not the best one I've ever had, but good. Their selections of sandwiches and salads looked so tempting that as I left, I grabbed a Turkey Club ($7) and tomato cucumber salad ($3) for lunch - that now that I have enjoyed, I now love this place.(I do realize their sandwiches and salads are provided by a third party... that's OK... they're still good and benefiting a good cause).The coffee is a la Just Love Coffee out of Murfreesboro, another company I thoroughly enjoy.I even brought back a dessert that is vegan and gluten free, and I thought to myself I know I won't like it, but wanted to try. I sound like Mikey, I know, I liked it! My choice is a cookie that is an Oreo sandwich - basically two large chocolate dense cookies almost like a brownie sandwiching white cream.

Will still be enjoying at 4 pm cookie.I love that the paper studio where the women of the program are making journals and gift tags, etc. is right there, and I love that they also sell their candles, lip balms, etc. How often can you combine a coffee fix, birthday gift shopping errand, and support a local charity all at once?I know I'll be back.

The only downside- Don't expect to get rice and beans with each plate- the last few times I've gone there was a small bowl of rice to share for all of the entrees.

70,"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou! I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. I've gone for all different types of visits. I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration. This place has it all. I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi. The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want. I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have. Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money. In addition there is a lot of space to sit. Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety. They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day. I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive. Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails. For the most part, everything is modestly priced. This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers. It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue. I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend. The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar. The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs. It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor. Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime. Overall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.

It was a half moon wooden table protruding from the wall but given the 25 minute wait for a table it worked just fine for us.Really you can't go wrong with a view quite like that. Sunbathers were laying out on the sand in front of the restaurant and beyond them was the gorgeous waves crashing on the shore.

I love beer, breweries, and it is on the way home...so why not?!?! The parking lot was pretty packed on a Monday afternoon. We were approached by the beer tour guides to see if we were interested in a tour. We ended up opting for the 10 dollar fresh day tour. There is a free tour, but with this tour you get a fresh bottle of Bud to bring home and the tour is longer. We killed time before our tour walking through their museum. So when the tour began we were excited. To be honest, one guide was great while the other one seemed like he was reading everything from a script. As for beer samples, you get two dixie cups of bud or bud light and a full glass of one of their beers at the end. Don't even ask for a refill cause you will get a big fat no. This tour pretty much sucked, since every brewery tour I've been on has allowed unlimited samples or at least 6 samples.

83,"Our recent date night at The Farm and Fisherman was pretty flawless. From the food to the service to the restaurant itself, it was a great evening. Judy was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu inside and out and had a real appreciation for food. Obviously, I like that in a server! We started out with delicious parker rolls - it was all I could do to not wolf the entire thing but I was trying to save my cals for the rest of the meal. Josh Lawler does some really incredible things with seasonal ingredients. This was showcased especially in the first course: grilled eggplant with burrata, and a slow roasted squash. Both plates were filled with vibrant colors from the ingredients and accompanying sauces. The flavors were wonderful, and every bite was different. Next I had scallops, which were served with pastrami and sweet corn. On point. Now that it's a couple weeks later, I don't remember what my dining partner had for his second course, but I do know he enjoyed whatever it was (helpful, I know). My main course was a grilled tri tip steak, which was very lean and very tender. It was served with lima beans, which I really liked as an alternate to the usual potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his bacon-wrapped quail. Who wouldn't love a teeny bird wrapped in bacon? For dessert we shared a lemon tart which was perfection. I'm literally shaking my head at the memory.

89,"20 dollar unlimited beverage brunch! Why hello there, Gypsy Saloon. Way to know exactly how to sweet talk me. Unfortunately, your words only lasted so long. Bffski and I had a very rare leisurely sunday brunch here around noon thirty. Our waitress was super dull and super basic. Not that she was UNfriendly or UNhelpful, just a bit uncaring. Meh. Their pre fix menu is not overly large, but I'm sure everyone could find something they liked. We each picked some savory southwestern eggy type deals and were off to the races. We were started off with a bread plate that was not bad at all. Unless you are on a diet, like we were pretending not to be on that day. Our main courses were pretty decent, and I liked the potatoes. Unfortunately, we were each missing nearly all of our flavorful condiments necessary for our plates to be enjoyed. I appreciated it did not take long to get our server's attention and seconds for the problem to be corrected with no hassle. Obviously it would have been better had they been on our plates already, but whatevs, we were already into our third mimosa course. All in all, the brunch was not bad, and it was a great atmosphere for the situation. We really liked the decor and the set up. This time would have been probably been 3 stars by itself. However, a few weeks later, bffski and I tried to go in for happy hour. Tried. We waited about twenty minutes at the very small bar and received no service. Wasted so much precious happy hour time and we just got up and left the bar with still not a word from anyone that worked there. In a way, it ended up being fate since we thought to walk across the street to Stella Blu, and had amazing service and an amazing happy hour. All in all, I don't plan on going back.

91,"This was the first time I have been to Jones in a few years since I moved back to Philly.  A few years back, I remember loving Jones, especially their mac and cheese and chicken and waffles.  I loved how they had so many comfort food dishes, like their chicken pot pie and thanksgiving dish.  Unfortunately, this time I went back to Jones, I was pretty disappointed.  I feel like the quality, taste, and presentation of a lot of the food has declined significantly.  The mac and cheese used to be one of my favorites, but this time I had it, it literally tasted like it was taken from the box, just baked.  I was also really disappointed in the fried chicken that accompanied the waffle.  I'm not sure if it's just that other restaurants have really perfected their fried chicken recipes or if Jones' dish just got worse. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and just surprised it didn't taste better.  It also looked more like diner food compared to before.  I remember it being a more upscale food presentation, but the food the time I most recently went was not well-presented.  I was also unimpressed with the fact that I ordered a cocktail and my glass came back only filled up half-way with the cocktail.

A long list of various margarita and cocktails are offered. We enjoyed the Prickley pear and Rojo matgaritas. Ryan is an efficient and interesting local man who tutored us on our first visit with tips about hikes, and activities to see in Tucson. Sitting at the bar is an opportunity to gather information from locals not found on line or in tour books. For instance it is prudent to check the weather forecast when traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for ""haboobs"". These are intense dust storms that can slow or stop travel. I'd never heard of such a thing.Flying V is rated high for food and service, a rating deserved. Upon several recommendations we settled on the rack of ribs for dinner to share, along with local vegetables and Caesar salad. All were delivered in shared portions and were excellent. The ribs were fall of the bone tender and tasty. Our server Kelsey was efficient and attentive to our every need. The restaurant has good acoustics and even when busy the noise level is acceptable.

Wanna drink a beer without your 3 year old, it possible at this restaurant. The restrooms are kid friendly also. Forgot your diaper, they got you. They have a good selection of different size diapers. Wanna work or finish a paper and have someone watch your kid. The food is pretty good but the portions are little small.

95,"I have never been so disappointed in the karaoke venue in my entire life... I made a reservation a week before my party, a small room. One of the nice things that I liked when I read online about ktop was that each karaoke room has its own bathroom! When I checked out the bathroom in our room the toilet was filled with B L O O D (SERIOUSLY!!) AND the floor was covered in an unpromising liquid substance... I don't know what it was because the floor is black but... I have a bad feeling I wouldn't want to know anyway. When we told someone, they simply flushed the toilet and let us know to be aware that the toilet was broken but we could still use it (???; though to be fair it maybe been a language barrier problem and maybe he couldn't explain what exactly was wrong with our toilet.) He also left the floor covered in whatever that was. Also, I am not exaggerating when I say that it was literally one fourth of the floor was flooded with whatever that ominous liquid was next to the toilet. I ended up requesting a different room, (one wasn't offered to me) and thankfully they complied... But this room wasn't much better. At first glance it looked pretty with the glowing lights and everything but it was very dirty and there was no toilet paper in the bathroom... We ended up having to use the box of tissues (go Kleenex!) that was in the room.The food was...... firstly the online menu is totally different from the actual menu... There was no japchae, no pineapple fried rice, no pad thai, no drunken noodles.... Nothing that could pass as a full entre or even was sized big enough to be shared! Instead we was just overpriced, under (or over) cooked appetizers and a variety of milk teas. An example is the potato shrimp which u have had else where and love- the outside was browned crispy but the inside was soft and pale raw potato... it didn't even cook well to the center... A lot of the food (crab Rangoon, lamb skewers, even the potato shrimp) was cold on arrival. Honestly it was just embarrassing... I can't imagine the chef themselves eating their own food and dm very surprised by the honestly terrible quality of the meals...The karaoke was alright. Quite a few of the songs were just music videos without lyrics and as such, they still had the voices of the actual singers, making it more of an unofficial singalong and somewhat defeating the purpose of karaoke. The song selection could've been a lot better and one of our mics was dead. We asked for another.... it also died. (We were only there for 2.5 hours, too...) All in all, it was extremely disappointed and wish I could get all two and a half of those hours back spent searching for common songs that weren't there. I will not be returning to this establishment, nor will I be recommending it to anyone. It's a shame that there aren't more karaoke venues in Chinatown that allow for underage guests because I really wanted to enjoy taking my younger friends and associates out... I guess I'll just wait till they're all 21 and take them to something a little more together.",karaoke venue,glowing lights,"karaoke venu, glowing lights","* Restaurants typically focus on serving food, and beverages, but do not typically have karaoke venues for entertainment.

This time, we decided to go a round lunch time on a Friday and though the place is rather small, we were able to see some tables just waiting to be bussed before we knew we could stay. Like many places I've been to eat after the pandemic, this place was short staffed and just trying to get a hostess or waitress to seat us took awhile. My wife flagged a woman down and she cleaned a spot for us and gave us real menus to look over. Once we had her attention, we quickly got our orders taken and beverages brought over. I ordered from the lunch menu (a yummy breaded tenderloin that remained moist and tender and mostly fit the bun. I asked for it loaded and even got some yellow mustard which she brought over without delay too. The breading had a nice seasoning too. Since I was eating, I also upgraded to a side salad that wasn't all weeds with a vinaigrette dressing. My wife ordered from the breakfast menu getting a waffle with strawberries and bananas. Not quite crisp enough for her preference, but a decent flavor. Her comment was that it could have been raised a level with some whipped cream on top. I suggested she ask but she didn't. Food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen compared to most local brunch spots I've been to lately. But manageable. One of the perks of this spot is that even if you have to wait, there are so many Indy 500 photos and collectibles inside that it is like a mini museum adventure looking around.

I know it's a sports bar but one guy at the bar was hollering like a maniac through our entire visit. It was Sunday at lunchtime, not late at night, and I was expecting a more relaxed experience. Every time this guy yelled, I jumped. The food was OK. The Impossible burger came as a patty melt with some extremely strange sauce on it that did not appeal to me. I wish this sauce had come on the side so that I could have avoided it and put my own condiments on the burger. Otherwise, the burger was fine.The fries were good but the ketchup was not. I'm partial to Heinz ketchup and the brand Trident III Grill serves in little plastic dipping cups pales in comparison. I think if you're serving burgers and fries at your restaurant that a top-notch ketchup is essential (since fries are sort of a ketchup delivery system anyway).On the plus side, there was an Arizona Greyhound Rescue event going on outside and I got a kick out of petting the hounds and talking with the rescue folks.
