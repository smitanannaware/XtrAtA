0,"There are only good things to say about the Gaylord opryland. There is so much you can do here like shopping and swimming and even great food places. I stayed her ewith my school's music department and the staff was all so kind and generous to us. All the food here is amazing and trusted with both local places you can find anywhere like pizza hut or Starbucks, but also have new places. The gift shops here are helpful, they have merchandise ranging from guitar picks and sweatshirts and even magnets, while having tourist needs like portable chargers, waterbottles, and backpacks. At this place I found the cheapest cowboy hats that were 100% real. At the resorts pool they have all sorts of things to do for all ages like the ""flow rider."" This is a surfing simulation where the instructors make it a point to help you out. Not only that but they have adult areas, water slides, a lazy river, and even a playground for little kids. The food place here has food that you would want for a very small price, it's mainly small dishes like French fries or chips but it's all still food you would want.

1,"By far the best hotel experience I've ever had. Even the missteps didn't seem so bad after management handled them with poise and grace.

Speaking of poise and grace, check-in was a breeze. We attempted to check-in early (like, way early) and our room wasn't ready. I gave my cell number and was given a promise that the desk would call when they were ready for us. In the meantime, the concierge gave us maps, coupons, booklets, advice, tips, a bottle of water and great advice to use during our stay. After a lunch using one of the coupons we received in the Quarter, I got the call the room was ready. 

Our room was great. It faced the street and not the courtyard (which I highly recommend) and it was plenty spacious--the jr. King suite. I almost forgot about the kitchenette once we checked in because breakfast each day was plentiful and the hospitality hour each evening was nice as well. The swimming pool is very small, indeed, but if you want to cool off, it does the job. 

Our shower had a leak and while it was fixed during the day when we were out, our room was not freshened and we had to call for new towels. As a matter of fact, our room was not freshened until our next to last day. When I called to ask about that, a manager called back to suggest we request a time during our next stay to make sure it happens. No problem.

That night a couple across the hall were arguing at 3 a.m. and being very loud. I let the front desk know and security came up almost immediately to deal with it. Quiet hours are posted (10 pm to 9 am) and they DO NOT PLAY, so if you plan on being rowdy in the hall, this is not the place for you. 

My only complaint: there is ONE bank of elevators and the hallway is veryyyyy lonnnggggg. Our room was 3/4 down the hall. 

Would I stay here again? Absolutely. So close to 3 trolley car lines, buses, the French Quarter and a police station. Do be careful if you walk behind the hotel in Basin St. as there seemed to be some drug activity, despite the police station being a block away.",,,,,"3 trolley car lines, buses, French Quarter, police statio",,"3 trolley car lines, buses, French Quarter, police statio",,,,"The hotel is close to 3 trolley car lines, buses, the French Quarter and a police station.

2,"Staff is amazing here. So helpful and supportive when we stayed in 2015. They knew we had a lot of stuff to load in our car, plus two little kids, so they let us take our time. We were way past the checkout hour by the time we left, lol! Hotel room was always clean, house keeping always prompt. They left the room neat as a pin. The breakfast had a lot of variety, including beverages. The breakfast area was nice to sit and relax in. The hotel itself is beautiful. You could tell the staff paid attention to cleanliness and detail. Only thing I was kind of put off by was that the bathroom and shower room didn't have locks, but that was a minor issue. I don't give five stars easily, lol, so I would definitely recommend this hotel!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

3,"Stayed here three nights on business. The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it. The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc.. The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings. It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area. About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum. There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance. The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful. The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings. My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early. You could use this as a dinner if you wanted. I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet). They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.

4,"This hotel is beautiful on the inside, but not worth the price. I checked in only to have a dirty room. The sheets had something that looked like blood on them and the bathroom floor was extremely dirty. Not to mention there was left over trash on the desk. But I called the front desk and they gave me a different room and free breakfast which was good. Although the second room was clean, we had marijuana smoke seeping into our room from the vents. If I wanted to smell marijuana I would've checked into a motel. Therefore, for the amount I paid for the room, I expected the room to be emaculate and the environment to be a little more family friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

5,I cant stand this hotel. I have had two very bad experiences here. I needed a room at 8pm one night and was going to be out by 5am and they were unwilling to accomodate or discount the rate. Im also a starwood member and they still were very unfriendly and I very un-accommodating. I would rather sleep in an alley then try to stay here again. They suck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

6,A group of us stayed here for our annual 'moms trip' in late May and stayed in the two story suite. It was plenty of room for everyone with great location and friendly staff. I would highly recommend staying here especially if you are looking for the historical feel. This is not a modern elevator sky-rise so keep that in mind. They helped organize us with a gator tour and plantation tour and we had a great trip.

7,"One of their guests went on a rampage and started punching random people, knocking one to the ground. I told the bartender to call security, then I restrained the assailant as efficiently as humanly possible, causing no injuries, no striking, basically a bear hug, until security finally arrived. Instead of a thank you I was told to go to my room or I would be trespassing--- fine, Did they look at the video and figure it out? Make it right later? No. I was treated poorly, and when I called days later, I got no response. Spoke with Art in Security, and no call back. 

Not the way to treat someone who helped you out. 

I will not be going back to Peppermill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

8,"Great spot that stays open late for locals to drink and not have to worry about all the tourist all the time.

The beers on tap are good and the service is friendly. My friend likes their drinks and the crowd that we have met.

The wings are good so I'm excited to go back to have dinner at the bar. They have a great bar that I enjoy going to. They also have 6 packs you can buy and carry out.

This is a great spot and I can't wait to go back and have some fun with my friends on a late night bar hopping venture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

9,"We stayed in a deluxe cabin over the 4th of July week. I was disappointed that it wasn't a real cabin. It's a trailer with wood siding. It's swept clean but don't walk barefoot or just in socks because it will become dirty. My cabin #80 had a few damage spots. The floor by the bed had 2 spots where one was covered by duct tape. In the bathroom there was a hole by the shower and it looks like someone stuck gum in it. The beds were not comfortable. The description said we'd get a futon but we had a pull out couch. The mattress was so thin you could feel every metal part. I liked that they had plates, bowls, silverware, mugs, glasses, and a few cooking and baking items. Make sure to bring bug spray. The flies come into the cabin when we were bringing our things in. You'll also get to see a few ants in the bathroom every morning. 

This park is definitely for families with young children. Even if you have young children I wouldn't stay more than 2 nights. There just aren't enough activities to keep you occupied. The daily activities start early in the morning and through the day and most cost extra.

The pictures of the water park are deceiving in size. It is only for little kids. The pool fills up quickly. They have 2 inflatable water slides. They offer fishing but it's for little ones because they only have guppies. Volleyball net is available but the sand got so hot it burned our skin. Definitely need to cover up. You can get balls on deposit. They claim to offer WiFi but we never got any WiFi service. My teens ended up using up our mobile data.

We ended up going outside camp for better activities for my teens. If you know you'll be back at camp after 8 p.m. make sure to get a gate pass. It's also on deposit.

It was nice and quiet. The air conditioner covers any noises anyway.

10,"This place was ok. The parking is free which is honestly unheard of in this area so that was good. Couple things that weren't good were that I reserved a concierge level room and when I got there was told there weren't any available but I got concierge access with a normal room. Interesting though as several folks checked in after me and got rooms on that level. I did check out the concierge lounge and it was TINY, i mean like closet sized so not sure it's worth it to pay more for that anyway. Also my keys didn't work to come from parking the car to the hotel so I had to walk down 3 ramps to go to the main entrance... when i told the front desk she was like ok and that was it. Wifi was good but I'll definitely stick with Marriott.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

11,"We used The Hollander Hotel for our wedding hotel and it was an absolutely incredible experience. I will never get tired of raving about our experience. We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding. Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't change a thing!

The hotel property is absolutely charming. The décor in the lobby is beautiful, eclectic, and very welcoming. The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties. The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too, and they all look wonderful!

The rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were. The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location. The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!

The brunch was perfect. Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast, but the food is delicious and homemade. The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly, fast, and takes great pride in his work. He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made! The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful! The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! 

Finally, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander. Nick and Will treated us like their own family. They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable. Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block. The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating. They take great pride in ensuring that every guest has a wonderful experience. We just adore everyone there! I absolutely loved working with them and would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

12,"This has been my fourth stop on my trip across country (from DC), and this place deserves at least a four star review. To begin, I paid 34$ for a one night stay in a two double bedroom. That in itself is incredible. As a pet owner, I was more than thrilled to see a beautiful strip of grass for my dog to use. It's been rough these last few states to find an area for him to use that he won't end up with those pokey stickers in his paws. They also have free doggy doo bags in case you forgot yours!

Overall, the room was clean, the AC cold (after a while, it took a little bit to cool the room) and there is free WiFi. 

Some of the downsides are that there are no refrigerators in the rooms (unless you get a king size bed/room I believe), there is very little complimentary items (just the basic soap bars and bottle shampoo) no hair dryer or coffee maker and not a large amount of parking if you're traveling with a trailer (however I didn't have an issue, but I could see how it could happen.)

13,"I cannot say enough about the accommodations at the JW. I was working a trade show in the Grand Ballroom today and needed to pump as I am a new mom. Nathan was so quick to help as I was searching for a location that I could use. He opened up a boardroom for me to use and locked it behind me so I would not be disturbed. I know there was at least one other mom that was accommodated at the same time I was. All of the facilities, as well as the boardroom, were impeccably clean. I am so grateful for how kind and wonderful the staff was. Big kudos to the JW and the staff for making such awesome arrangements to support working moms- totally made my day!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

14,"Overall, this is a nicely appointed hotel with nice rooms, good service, and good amenities. The exterior and facade is beautiful as is the common space in the hotel. Carousel bar is nice and unique--definitely best hotel bar in NOLA (loews swizzle stick i like too), but is often too much of a zoo/scene. The location is awesome, much better than being right on Canal in the ritz or right next to the casino out of the way at windsor court. 

I generally don't deal much with hotel service when I stay in hotels but from the limited experience it's been good. Generally I get in and out, which is always smooth here. I've stayed in a few rooms on a few different floors. The suites and larger rooms on upper floors are WAY nicer than the lower floors, but still there is no problem with even the smaller rooms. My favorite part about Monteleone--the pool and spa aria!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

15,"If I could rate the Casino/Gameroom separately from the hotel, I would give that 4 stars. I recall coming here since I was a little kid and spent hours playing games and bringing home a trunk full of new toys and stuffed animals. Meanwhile, the grown-ups would spend hours in the casino and we would all meet up at the end of the day for dinner and whatnot. Now that I am a grown up, I occasionally walk around the game room although it seems so much smaller when I'm this big, haha. But the casino is nice. If/when I do have kids I will probably do family trips here just like my family did when I was a kid.

Now onto the hotel. I would give the hotel a 2-star rating. It's basically like a circus themed motel-which I guess kinda makes sense since I did pay motel-like prices. Still, there should at least be some decent standards for their rooms. My room had a kind-of funky smell upon walking in. There weren't really any convenient outlets near the bed. The wi-fi was pretty slow, even considering it only allows 2 devices to be connected per room. Pillows were the flattest pillows I have ever used and the bed sheets were made very sloppily and the wrong way. Bath towels were so stiff and felt so rough, might as well try to dry yourself with newspaper. The face towels had make-up on them (which I do not wear make up and thankfully neither does my boyfriend). The shower head was made for power washing hobbits, I'm only 5'4"" but I basically had to crouch to get under the water, which did not have a shower effect. Also, the shower curtains looked very grimey. Other than that, the express check-out on the TV was a cool feature and the view from our room was not too bad-it was nice to see the city lights.

Overall, I would come back to play in the casino and gameroom, but I will probably not stay in the hotel again.",modified,Casino/Gameroom,,,,Casino/Gameroom,Casino/Gameroom,The hotel has a Casino/Gameroom.,,,,The hotel has a Casino/Gameroom.,The hotel has a Casino/Gameroom.,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

16,"We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to ""ohh and ahh"" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking ""oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!""  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives... its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision... we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart.

18,"First thing about this place is they have great service. The room was kept very clean, a little out-dated in some aspects but the important stuff was great. I also enjoyed waking up to my windshield and windows on my car cleaned. The bed was VERY comfortable, and I enjoyed the fruit in the room. There is also a fitness room and a massage room (didn't get to try that). Free wi-fi which also allows you to print to their lobby.

19,"I am very undecided about my feelings for this place, it has its good and bad so I would rate it average.

For a Hilton, the customer service was good, especially the girl during the morning to afternoon shift was nice and helpful and she wore a smile(very unusual these days for the hospitality industry) The lady serving breakfast early morning was very nice as well.

I purchased breakfast while booking and it was helpful, they have options from continental to individual selection, including pancakes and eggs(any style)
It's strategically located in Goleta across a big shopping complex that includes Costco,Target,Starbucks and a lot of other food options.

What I didn't like was the room, there is absolutely no ventilation, even in the bathroom. The room was very small and didn't have enough lights. Also housekeeping is for 2 nights or more. For the price I would have expected a better room.

Since I booked using Expedia,Hilton honors does not count, bummer!

There are enough things to do around the area, State st is about 10 or so miles but there is a small farmers market on Sunday's right across and there is a nice hike to the butterfly field to wind down.

22,"Comfortable beds!
The hotel is overall very good, but most impressive were the beds... they're comfortable! Most hotels cheap out & buy hard (uncomfortable) beds because they last longer, but Drury's were great and we slept really well.

The location is good for the value, and the hotel is very accessible.

Bathrooms were very clean, and had LOTS of water... more water out of a shower head than I can remember at any hotel ever (usually it's just a trickle).

Free breakfast and snacky dinner were good, though only an idiot would stay in NOLA and fill up on free hotel hot dogs.

The only negative is the loud hall & door latches. All night long you hear other rooms' doors going KA-CHUNK.

Free WiFi is nice... amazing that some hotels still charge for this.

After the Royal Sonesta, this is my new favorite NOLA hotel (and it costs 1/2 as much).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

25,"Hotel Indigo markets itself as a hipster, environmentally friendly hotel. We chose to stay there because we do try to be environmentally friendly, we liked the price and we liked the location which was near to the tasting rooms that we planned to visit. We had read that it was located right near an Amtrak station, but since the trains don't run overnight we weren't concerned.

The hotel is fairly small with a creatively painted mural on the side. Parking is in the lot next door. When you walk in, you are greeted with lots of gleaming golden wood. The staff at the desk was friendly and explained everything we needed to know, including the free wifi password. There is a small luggage elevator, but it was not working, so we had to carry our luggage up the flight of stairs.

The bedroom was small, but comfortable and every bit of space was cleverly used.  As a photographer, I loved the huge blown up photo of a camera on the wall behind our bed, I also appreciated the safe, where I stored my camera and lenses when we went out to eat. There is no continental breakfast, but there is a restaurant next door.

One of my favorite parts was the little library sitting area out in the open area between the rooms. It was filled with art books and photography books, perfect for resting and glancing through.

The most interesting use of space, however was the bathroom. The shower is created by closing a clear glass door that is right in front of the commode. So, that literally if you are going to the bathroom, your feet are in the shower. It is the most ingenious use of space. Some people might not like this, but we had no problems with it.

Property: not too big but has 2 beautiful pools (family and adult) with nicely decorated rooms, lobby and grounds. Their explorer program (for kids) is really awesome! Check it out if you want some alone time at the resort! We didn't take advantage this time but will do so next time!
Rooms: we loved the beach house! It was nice and roomy with great amenities for the kids (sand toys, bear plush and children bath products!) 
Service: ordered room service multiple times, it all came in 30 min and everyone from the front desk to valet were super friendly. Shout out to Oliver at the front desk who totally charmed my 4 year old with a lego set upon check in! 
Food: the room service menu and their on site restaurants, caruso's and Malibu farms were all very good. Their kids meal (explorer's) options were a hit despite being more sophisticated offerings than most kids menus, my 4 year old developed a love for fresh mozzarella on his pizza now lol. 
Pros: I loved how the beach house provided close beach access just a few steps away, so great for kids. They knew we were bringing a baby along too and provided a crib, bottle warmer, baby changing table, diaper pail, baby bath and even a step stool for my toddler along with bath products and toys. Their staff were all so warm and welcoming and the grounds and rooms were immaculate and squeaky clean. 
Cons: my husband said the concierge was a bit slow to respond and difficult to work with when he tried to schedule flowers for me in the room, but the flowers turned out to be so beautiful and I didn't care it was one day late. Also, this is NBD but usually at resorts with rooms around this price point (post ranch inn, the aman resorts etc) offer complimentary snacks in the mini bar. It provides a nice touch for guests when they are paying $$$$, just something to think about. :)

28,"When I needed a getaway but didn't care to leave the Bay Area I chose this place for a three night stay in a Casita Suite. The Casitas, and Casita suites are located on the resort hide of the hotel which is a good length away from the main building which you can get to by shuttle or by taking the scenic boardwalk (Hint...if you're checking in take the shuttle...those little suitcase rollers on the boardwalk were not condusive to speed)

The Suite itself was gorgeous. Two levels, french doors opening to the bay, a large glass shower, mini kitchen with wine refrigerater as well as regular mini frig, a view from the upstairs bedroom to kill for!

Outside the front door were koi ponds and lovely grounds along with a private walkway that led to a private beach, pool area and large docking area for your boat.

Upon check in I received a bottle of wine with cheeses and fruits and had plenty for two evening worth of snacks before heading out for dinner. They have Armani's restaurant as well as Oystercatchers here (See seperate reviews) which are both lovely in themselves.

Room service was prompt and delicious. Maids were unseen and efficient. 

The only issue I had was when I decided to stay an extra night the front desk clerk told me they were ""fully committed"" so I went online and booked a casita room no issue. I then called the front desk and spoke to same person who stated ""someone must have cancelled"" I requested to be upgraded to Casita Suite and to stay in the same room I was in. Her reply? ""Of course for $150 more per night"" Not an issue,my issue is why the games? She coudl have very easily rebooked the same room for me without jumping through hoops. At the $500 price range per night I expect more than that.

29,"We stayed at this hotel for the New Year's Eve celebration and had a room with a beautiful view of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the fireworks display. It was a wonderful show and my family and I were going to sleep when we began to smell someone lighting up a marijuana joint. We called security and they sent someone up. It was determined that the smell was possibly coming from the vents. They said they'd check around. They said they could not determine where it was coming from.  The smell then got worse and it was coming from the door that was adjoining the two rooms. We called security again. He then entered the room and also determined that the smell was coming from the next door room.  He knocked on the door and identified himself as security but no one would open the door. They told us technically if they don't want to answer the door they don't have to.  Really? This is a no smoking hotel and our room is full of smoke but you're going to allow it because they don't want to answer the door?  They said all they could do was charge them a cleaning fee.  Eventually the party subsided but why should others have to suffer because you have a policy and rules that you can't enforce?  We're not prudes and we're not against partying but when you're traveling with family (including children) the last thing you want to have to deal with is marijuana wafting into your room while you're trying to sleep. 

Management did eventually do a service recovery and that is why I did not give them a totally low score but there's no way other hotels would have allowed that to happen.

31,"My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights at the White Stallion Ranch last week. The staff was pleasant and helpful (dining room, front desk, wranglers, gift shop staff, cleaning staff, etc). The grounds were well maintained and beautiful. The nightly activities were very enjoyable-Loop Rawlings, a magician, a critter show, and a country singer. The horses were great and well cared for. They offer many different rides each day- slow flat, fast flat, slow mountain, fast mountain, 1/2 day, full day. We had the same horses the entire time which was nice. You can ride 1-2 times per day or not at all. They also had other activities during the day that we weren't able to do because we were riding. The scenery was beautiful. We did the Movie tour with Marty which was really interesting and fun. He's a wealth of knowledge. The pool and hot tub were very relaxing- very few people there. Our room was clean and comfortable and was right next to one of the pastures, so we got to visit with the horses all day. There is no TV in rooms so it was peaceful. The gift shop had a lot of really nice things and not too expensive. There is a petting zoo on the property. 
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the food , although abundant, was mediocre. The breakfast is buffet plus you can also place order for eggs/pancakes. Breakfast wasn't bad. Lunch is also buffet with many options of hot and cold foods-tacos and brisket sandwich were the best lunch meals. There was always lunch meat, salad and fruit available at lunch. Dinner just wasn't very good, not much seasoning and the steak was tough, chicken had no meat on it, pork was ok. There were also options at dinner. The vegetables were usually cooked well. Desserts were not anything special. We really loved everything else about the ranch.

33,"Having stayed here several times, it is my favorite hotel. The staff is excellent. Really exceptional. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets.

Rooms are clean, heating and AC are quiet, beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special.

Special K is awesome. I cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits. One of the best reasons to visit this hotel. Did I mention the exceptional staff?

Turn-down service is Sucre chocolates on your pillow. Sweets for the sweet dreams.

The bathroom wasn't as slippery this time. 

This was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great. No more than a 10 minute wait for the car. You can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take.

They also hosted a Gold Status reception. We made a brief appearance on our way to a Mardi Gras ball.

Our only glitch was a mini-bar charge on our bill. We didn't consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill.

We will be back. Note to hotel: please put Louis back in the elevator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

Sure, it can be touristy, but the architecture, art galleries, rich cultural history of the French Quarter are more than enough to draw the explorer in.

We knew we wanted to be close to Bourbon street and many other options were booked, when we found this place online we immediately knew we had to get it. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a courteous young man at the desk. He was great at offering suggestions for nearby attractions and we were very thankful. The lobby is very pretty. Our room was up three flights of stairs, a nice little work out for sure. I really liked our room; nice comfy bed, but very small.

38,"Absolutely one of the best experiences for myself and my family. 

This review is waaaaay overdue. We arrived to Terrell House for a wedding. The place is spectacular. Like stepping into the 1800s, except with all the modern accomodations (AC, etc).

Linda, the owner is a sweetheart. She's a wonderful and kind person with a whole lot of patience for a 16 month old that thinks every sphere shaped object is a bouncy ball.

Every morning the chef waited for us to come downstairs before putting out some delicious, authentic Louisiana food. Seriously...it was exceptional.

More of awesome treatment...skipping to the end. We thanked everyone and left, forgetting our car seat and some other items. 

Linda, shipped the items to us out of her own pocket...!!!!!! WHAT? I have never heard of such AMAZING treatment.

There's no other place that I will even consider staying at when I visit New Orleans.

40,"We stayed here for a family weekend getaway to Tampa. I've stayed at many SpringHill Suites because I know what to expect. We checked into room 506 which was a king suite with a fold-out couch. I went to make the bed on the sofa sleeper and realized that even though the sleeper bedding was in the closet, we had no pillows for it. I then went into the bathroom and discovered we did not have enough towels. I called down to the front desk and they came up in a flash with more towels and pillows. The bed was comfy and overall it was a pleasant stay. The breakfast is your average hotel breakfast - waffle iron, eggs, cereal, toast, bagels, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt, and coffee. All of the employees we encountered, especially the breakfast area, were friendly. The young lady who tended to the breakfast area even brought over a coloring book and crayons for my youngest, and a journal for my oldest child. Things like that really made me remember why I book with SpringHill. 

Two downsides - our AC was extremely loud. Each time it cycled on, it made a constant loud vibration noise. I eventually pushed a piece of luggage up to it and it stopped.

Separate them using commas. context: We stayed here for a family weekend getaway to Tampa. I've stayed at many SpringHill Suites because I know what to expect. We checked into room 506 which was a king suite with a fold-out couch. I went to make the bed on the sofa sleeper and realized that even though the sleeper bedding was in the closet, we had no pillows for it. I then went into the bathroom and discovered we did not have enough towels. I called down to the front desk and they came up in a flash with more towels and pillows. The bed was comfy and overall it was a pleasant stay. The breakfast is your average hotel breakfast - waffle iron, eggs, cereal, toast, bagels, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt, and coffee. All of the employees we encountered, especially the breakfast area, were friendly. The young lady who tended to the breakfast area even brought over a coloring book and crayons for my youngest, and a journal for my oldest child. Things like that really made me remember why I book with SpringHill. 

Two downsides - our AC was extremely loud. Each time it cycled on, it made a constant loud vibration noise. I eventually pushed a piece of luggage up to it and it stopped. Also, our room faced the street and the windows are extremely thin. The street outside of SpringHill is very busy so whenever loud cars drove by, you could hear them perfectly. 

I'll definitely use this hotel again, I will just ask for a room that doesn't face the street."
41,"I mistakenly left my organizer/wallet on my table when eating at Shepard's yesterday (6/24/12). I realized the mistake early this morning and called Shepard's. I was told that no one turned in anything resembling my organizer. 

I called back a few hours later to try and determine who bussed my table and what management was on duty and was told that my organizer had indeed been found and was in the """"safe"""". I asked about the contents of the wallet and discovered that everything was present except for a $100 bill that I had just gotten the night before. I have witnesses to the $100 bill being in the organizer. 

I went today to retrieve the organizer and met with the assistant manager, who told me it was not their responsibility to keep track of guests belongings and would not investigate the issue whatsoever. She would not approach the server, would not ask who turned the organizer in, would not ask who stored it in the safe and essentially told me it was not her problem. 

This is customer service at it's worst... I have no recourse at this establishment to even try to get my money back.

The suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out' How is that possible so quickly?

43,"Don't let the location or the exterior of this little establishment fool you. We were pleasantly surprised by how clean the place is and how modern the rooms were. They must have recently upgraded and did some remodeling. We had a King sized bed in our room and it was spacious and beautiful plantation shutters over their windows. Flat screen TV, cute little decorative touches, and their bathroom was OMG!!! I want my own home bathroom to look like that! Beautiful granite counter-tops and granite walls in the shower.
The only negative was the strangely scheduled demolition of their parking lot on a Sunday morning at 10am. I mean, we were up and all but we were asked to move our car and then the noise was just insane. Thankfully we checked out that day at 11am. Whoever scheduled that construction work must've had screw loose. 
Anyway, you won't be disappointed. We went on Valentine's Day weekend, so prices were a bit higher.

44,"Great hotel, but BEWARE of the hidden fees, such as the absurd ""daily"" resort fees. Apparently they help cover the pool which is great, when it's actually open and fully staffed. 

The fees also provide you with the self check-in machine, which frequently has issues that force you to stand in a cattle line ... forever ... Generally, they're squeezing people for nickels and dimes, instead of giving you incentives to come back.

The security is great, except if they take a disliking to you, i.e. don't tell your waiter that the balding middle aged person with you doesn't have an ID, but is old enough to drink - that is if you don't want a Reno 911 swat team swarming your table. Yeah that's right, no drink was ordered or served, but the high crime of being drinking age in a bar ""that serves food"" was definitely in play. W to the T to F?

Club La Douche ... or whatever it's called, is like frat boy pimps and hoes party. It would be nice if they'd book some real djs with real music to play, and have an occasional dance night with a hint of class, instead of people puking in the plants.

46,"This was our first stop from a long weekend getaway with my gf up the Central Coast. She booked us this little gem as a surprise for our Anniversary. Canary's simple, decorated in the ethnic Spanish style that's indigenous to Santa Barbara. 

That Spanish theme carries throughout the hotel and rooms. We stayed in a lovely Deluxe suite room. Pretty small for a suite. The rooms were artistically decorated. From the beautiful spiral carved canopy bed to the imported bathroom tiles, it's well thought out. Nothing short of modern amenities... you get two flat screens, DVD/CD player (don't like the fact that it was hidden inside a drawer. Would've never known if my gf wasn't looking for it), and an ipod docking station. I also like that it has a separate bath tub and shower (w/ rain shower-head), two guest bathrobes, complimentary newspaper, binoculars for bird watching, yoga mat, a cute little rubber froggy floatee for your bath, and a black ""makeup"" towel for my woman to wipe her cosmetics on. 

The other pluses about the Canary were the bike rentals, roof top deck & pool w/ a 360 degree view of Santa Barbara, proximity to all the major attractions, located across from Saks, and half a block from State St.

I was going to give it 4 stars, but after careful consideration, plus time to ponder on their shortcomings... I had to drop it down to 3-3.5 stars. For an ADR (average daily rate) of $300+ the amenities were lacking, or lack there-of. Aside from the small room, my room's view (I was on the 8th floor) was of the tiered parking garage. There's no gym or spa center (use athletic club next door for a charge), elevators were slow (had only two), the restaurant food wasn't good, and when we checked out there was only one Front desk agent. We were in a hurry and needed to be out, unfortunately she was on the phone which held us up for another 5 minutes. We couldn't help but get a bit annoyed. It wasn't her fault, but there should be at least two people doing front desk.

47,"Staying at Sheraton for the IBEW which was awesome. The room was great, the events on the 21st floor and the Lower Level were done exceptionally well. I give high five to the service staff, face painters, and Santa clause.

DO NOT GO TO THE BAR!!!


When the circle of lights was over and our group went down to the bar. That's when things went from amazing to tragic. The bar service is unbelievably HORRIBLE. I feel the whole staff either hates what they do or they are in need of retirement. The words I will be right with you should never follow waiting 10min and then asking for service. Then we moved to the bar thinking it would be faster and we were WAY wrong. We got ignored yet again and only after waiting longer after asking for service and being told yet again someone would be right with us.

If you're visiting Philadelphia and are looking to explore some of the sites in the old city this is definitely the place to go.

The bed is very firm, so be aware of that if you have issues with that type of bed. Also, parking is by valet only and costs $50 which is quite steep. If you don't mind the walk, there is a parking garage, Bourse, about a block and a half away which only charges $28. There are also no garbage bags in the room which can be quite annoying when you're traveling with pets. There was also a dog on my floor which kept barking for about five hours straight numerous nights in a row. The hotel staff did not seem to be able to handle this situation, except to call my room asking me to control and handle my dogs which were silent. Finally, there was a fire alarm that went off which forced us to evacuate from the tenth floor with the dogs which wasn't much fun using the stairs.

53,"One of the main reasons I frequent the Four Seasons Biltmore, Santa Barbara is because of its close proximity the Pacific Ocean and its VIP entrance during hotel stay to Coral.

Here you can workout, spa, swim in Olympic size pool, dive, jacuzzi with Pacific views, grab a complimentary surfboard and use private access gate to access Butterfly Beach.

It is easy to spend a day on the deck, recline, nestle in a cabana and lay pool side. If you stay long enough a cool amenity is passed, usually a smoothie, fruit skewers, etc.

Poolside service is 5-star quality, I have always found the people taking care of my party to be extra attentive.

The lunch menu changes daily but there's always a good veggie plate, like hummus!

Here you can workout, spa, swim in Olympic size pool, dive, jacuzzi with Pacific views, grab a complimentary surfboard and use private access gate to access Butterfly Beach.

It is easy to spend a day on the deck, recline, nestle in a cabana and lay pool side. If you stay long enough a cool amenity is passed, usually a smoothie, fruit skewers, etc.

Poolside service is 5-star quality, I have always found the people taking care of my party to be extra attentive.

The lunch menu changes daily but there's always a good veggie plate, like hummus!

54,"Location is excellent! Five minute walk to a nice beach where you can rent boards or skate down the path. Beach is great for sun bathing and swimming and that's what mattered to us most. Very close produce stand, eateries and wine tasting. We drove down to State street for drinks and apps, foot massages and Salt Cave! Pool is super nice as well, gets plenty of sun and stays nice and heated. All rooms have salt lamps and organic shampoo, lotion. You can tell they are super mindful about their choices. Hosts are super accommodating and go out of their way to make sure you're enjoying yourself. They also serve local coffee and home baked goods in the morning, giving it much of a B & B feel. 

We would have liked to see a refrigerator in the room but we just ended up using our small cooler. We felt like the feng shui was a little off. Like the chairs should have been facing out toward the view. Built in ""desk"" could easily be converted or double as a vanity table with proper lighting and a mirror. Shelves in the shower would be nice but it was modern and clean which is much appreciated. Beds were super comfortable. The closet serves as a pretty big walk in fit for changing and storing luggage. We loved the Buddhist book in room and my friend said she would have liked to see more spiritual books since this place seems to be attractive for people seeking a spiritual retreat. She also mentioned perhaps some photography art on the walls but simplicity seems fitting to the hotels personal taste and style.

The Presidio is what the W or the Standard in LA claim to be: where the cool kids hang out with no pretense. The rooms are everything needed in a comfy, no-stress, charming way.

58,"This place is super fun, so much that it seems I'm here all the time. The Morris Burner Hotel is in a historic building right near downtown Reno. It's not in the best part of town, but it's part of an effort being made to make 4th St fun and interesting again. It's only a block away from the bus station and only a couple blocks from the main casinos. It is a hotel created by Burners, so it has a very Burning Man vibe and they encourage everyone to practice radical inclusion, self-expression, civic responsibility and the other principles of Burning Man.

You don't have to be a Burner to stay here or attend their many events though. In the last few months I've attended several poetry readings, parties, a folk festival, and an art show here, plus stayed in one of the fun rooms.

Each of the rooms is being decorated by a different artist in a different theme, so far there are:
The Goddess Room (my fave)
The Southwest Room
The Forest Lord Room
The Sparkle Pony Room (glitter and girly and fun)
The Rock and Roll Room
The Alice in Wonderland Room (a black&white spiral across the room makes for a powerful impact)

This is not a plug-and-play hotel, so much as it is an experience in and of itself. It has a very hostel feel, people are coming to stay there from all over the world, most rooms share the main bathrooms, and there are often communal dinners. It has a comfortable feel like you are at a fabulous someone's home.

59,My fiancé and I stayed here for just one night for an early Valentine's Day getaway. We stayed in the San Clemente Casita and it was perfect. I was really impressed by the level of customer service we received. There were chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals around the tub when we arrived which was a really nice extra touch. We got a text the morning we were checking in asking if we were planning to be there before 3 to let them know. When we said our ETA was 2pm they promptly responded they'd make sure our room was ready. The casita was well worth the money. We'll definitely be back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

60,"Best Western, y for u have low reviews? 

I'm here to tell you that the lowies are undeserved, this place killed it for me. It's a 3min downhill jaunt to Broadway and downtown (and by the time you walk back up the hill you're probably drunk, at least I was, so you don't even notice it). 

My bed was a giant soft king that enveloped me like an affectionate giant and didn't let go until I begged that I had to get to the airport. The pillows - 4 small square-ish ones - are slightly weird if you're used to normal oblong ones, but there's enough of them that you can manufacture a satisfactory solution. 

The bathroom was spotless, so too was the carpet, and my room looked out onto Capitol Hill where the sunset swept in and bathed everything in molten light like some kind of Renaissance painting of yore. All I needed was a pleasingly plump woman and a man with a tiny penis reclining on the bed to complete the picture.

61,"WOW! A 5 star review for a hotel like the Holiday Inn?! Yes, it's quite accurate! And picky Yelper Richie is here to explain why:
-They manager upgraded me to a double occupancy room for free at check-in.
-Since I was staying 12 days (on a business trip), they brought in a microwave and refrigerator.
-The staff was always really friendly and willing to serve you to their best abilities.
-Even though the hotel is a bit older, it is kept up and clean (I found not even one hair on the bathroom floor at the entrance glance! Hard to find!)
-Gifts would always be left for me when I arrived back at the hotel after a long day of training. Popcorn, snacks, a Happy Mardi Gras basket with a bunch of goodies and bead necklaces...
-They give you a menu of pillows to choose from (in addition to the 4 mini pillows already on your bed). I personally loved the Firm Pillow & U-Neck Pillow.
-FREE WI-FI!!!!!! (Hence how I'm writing this review).
-Automated wake-up call system that wakes you up 3 minutes before when you set it.
-The room service is prompt. I would order my to-go breakfast in the morning and it would be waiting for me at 7:45, along with the check to run out.
-I left my phone charger in my room and they had it there are the desk. They seem to learn who their clients are which makes it more personalized.
-One of the managers told me that they're trying to become ""green"". We'll see what happens but they'll have to get rid of smoking to begin.
-The best for last...
It was my 1.5 year anniversary with my boyfriend who secretly sent me an Edible Arrangement of chocolate-dipped strawberries. They left a voicemail in my room and then called again later to let me know that something was in the lobby for me. The desk worker handed over the gift, wished me a Happy Anniversary and winked. Gay friendly staff plus.

I was a bit concerned making the reservation at first due to:
-Only an outdoor pool
-Location far from MetroLink and only close to The Hill Italian neighborhood
-There are smoking rooms still. BE SURE to request the 3rd floor if you're allergic to smoke or are just not a smoker because the other floors are either every other room or the far end of the hall is smoking.
-Simply it's a Holiday Inn

63,"My fiancé and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 4 nights for the Epicor convention. Stunning view is an understatement. Every square inch is covered in indoor lush tropical gardens, rivers, ponds with koi, and several waterfalls. Being the incredible size it is, you must carry a map or stop at their map stations to figure out where you are. Every where you turn, is an incredible photo opportunity. This a place of intriguing explorations of multilevel curiosities. It takes a small village to keep this resort running. Truly the Disney world for adults. Staff is trained to smile and offer warm hellos as you walk by, offer professional prompt service, and jump to their feet if you say ""boo"". I don't know how the staff does it. I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know able you, but I don't clean toilets with a peppy smile. Perhaps supergluing their faces with a permanent smile and a secret record button they press when you walk by. There are many many different bars and restaurants to choose from. Anywhere from fun casual to trendy to fine dining. The banquet food offered everyday was a hit or miss. The quality was there, especially for banquet food, but it mostly depended on your personal taste preference. We visited 2 restaurants and even room service. Each was very good and service was on par. Downside is that everything is extremely expensive. A dollar store type of cheap tre semme travel pump hairspray was almost $7. So don't forget your hairspray or deodorant people. I was already expecting inflated prices in the stores and bar because of the location, however, we almost peed our pants when we got our drink bill. $67 for 4 cheap bicardi and cokes. I'm scared what the bill would have been had we ordered a high end liquor. So back to the convention for the free drinks we went. I visited the spa. 20% gratuity was included in the bill. Which is ok. I would have tipped 18-20% anyways. The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas, but I'd have to admit, it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards. 

The downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend, but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort, with no reason to leave, for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests? 

So after my ridiculous blabbing, I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing, there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children.

The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas, but I'd have to admit, it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards. 

The downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend, but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort, with no reason to leave, for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests? 

So after my ridiculous blabbing, I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing, there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children. They would definitely be bored."
64,"Its a hotel and you can stay there.

After a couple of stays here I find it is not bad. 

Its definitely more of a business traveler kind of place than a tourist kind of place.

Pros
The rooms have the essentials. The beds are quite comfortable.
The cafe isn't bad although it is a little foggy as to what comes with the room. Apparently its one entree and one beverage. Not a bad deal.

Cons
Hallways are a bit shaggy. NBD since I am not staying in the hallway.
Room cleaning dropped the ball on my last stay. The room was clean, but I found a bag from BK in my mini fridge ... eeeew!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

Check in was a breeze.  We had a good price on the room via my Sheraton/SPG member and AAA discount, which included the free breakfast.  The hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport, and there are several other hotels right on the same block.

69,"Four stars for a wonderful experience at this local landmark. There's just something so cool about staying somewhere with such a rich history. First of all, a first run movie theater? How cool is that? Hair salon, florist, several restaurants and bars, on-site events staff and more - can I just move in? I guess I could for a few million (the residences). I didn't get to hang at the pool, but it looks amazing!

My room (if you can call it that) was roughly the same size as my first house. A full kitchen, large living room, massive bedroom and big bathroom - literally like 1,000 square feet - it was epic! The bed was great, the bathroom lovely, I truly could not have asked for a better room. It was not spotless, however, especially when I had to look around for plugs for laptops and phone chargers and the like, but it's seriously such a big room I don't know how they could keep it perfect. I could have used a heavier blanket, and though I guess I could have called for one, there should have been something in the closet.

This is like the mini equivalent of LV Cosmopolitan & City Centre: chic, sexy, clean, service oriented and overflowing with activities and amenities. Everything is new. Even the towels! Not your normal crunchy sandpaper ones! There's a starbucks, gift shop that sells doggie treats for the canine guests. Yes this luxury hotel is pet friendly. There's so much to do you dont want to leave: daily showings at the cinema (saw the hobbit for $4!!!!), live comedy shows and concerts, lounge w dj and dance floor, spa services, mechanical bull, fine dining restaurants, DAILY FITNESS CLASSES! what the mother effing f**! They have outside activities too like go karting, bungee gliding, driving range with floating targets on a lake! (See photo)

We got a spacious king size room with a gorgeous view of the golf putting lake (see photos). The shower is amazing and the bed is ridiculously comfortable; I could stay in my room all day!

tips:
- Sign up free for players club and get a free spin for dining/shopping credit between $5-$500. Its actually just a kiosk but that didnt stop me from chanting, ""big money big money!"" You also get a 2 for 1 buffet voucher good sun-thurs

74,"We are so very excited to return to UCSB Family Vacation Center for the third year in a row. This vacation has proven to be the most relaxing week we have experienced since becoming parents 8 years ago. Why do we love it so? Let me count the ways:

1) The counselors - they know how to pick um! The counselors are fun, energetic, caring, and really like our kids! Our kids REALLY like them too, which means we don't feel guilty when the counselors take them for a fun field trip for the day or engage them in all the other fun programming they have for kids. Our kids told us last year that it would ""break their hearts"" if we didn't return to family camp this year! Not that is an endorsement!
2) The location - you really can't beat being on the ocean in Santa Barbara. This place just reeks of happiness/fun/sunshine.
3) The adult activities - they have a wide variety of fun things for adults, surfing, kayaking, hiking, biking, nights out on the town, fun evening activities like karaoke, trivia night, etc.  We loved meeting other couples at the camp and felt like we made a whole bunch of new friends each year.
4) The food - yes, it is campus style, but the food is really good. The cafeteria offers a variety of food that satisfies even the pickiest of little eaters.
5) Balance - The program does an amazing job of balancing adult, kid and family time. They have really figured out the schedule so that you don't feel torn between doing adult activities and caring for your kids.  There is enough family time as well so that you definitely feel like you spent a lot of time with your kids during the week, but also a great amount of adult time as well.
6) Babysitting - If you need more adult time in the later evenings or even during the daytime, there are counselors happy to watch your kids. And the kids are so happy when the counselors show up at your door, because they know them already!
7) Non-commercial - Unlike other vacations, you never feel nickel and dimed. There are very few things that you have to pay ""extra"" for. We love that! For instance, one of the counselors is the professional photographer all week. He goes around for the whole week, taking photos of everyone and everything and then downloads all the photos onto a CD that you can buy for $10.  We have some of the best photos of our family on those CDs!
8. You will feel like you are back in college, even if it is only for a week! :)

A huge plus was the non-smoking hotel that doesn't allow smoking throughout. Attentive service and wonderful experience. Great ambiance and decor as i loved the courtyard fountain area at night to just relax after a day in NOLA. Bathrooms were a bit small and the shower could of used a door as water splashed out to the main area but overall it was a comfy room. Free wifi and the staff service was impeccable. We had a fuse blown and the repair was done in 15 min. after we called it in. Another plus is the free bottled water everyday as they gave us 2 bottles on the dresser along with 2 in the fridge.

76,"Having lived in center city Philadelphia previously, I was familiar with the Doubletree, and had high expectations. For the most part, this hotel delivers. When we checked in on Thursday evening the night staff (especially Kim) was very friendly and helpful. The accommodations were very nice, parking convenient (yes $25/day is high and standard for Philly, but you can exit and return for an unlimited # of times in the 24 hours, which is nice) and the rooms were nice and clean. 

The cons: you have to pay for the internet, which is ridiculous! Also, during my stay I got locked in the sauna area on the pool/fitness level (not sure what was up, but I was able to use my key to get in but not out). I was very lucky that there were other guests coming in and out that night (it was 10pm, a low traffic time of day), and they let me out.

77,"Stayed at Hotel Modern for my trip to NOLA last week and was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. Considering the cost for what we got, my rating for the hotel itself is two stars, but I'm bumping it up to three for the kind staff.

First off, when booking online, we were given a choice between a small, medium, or large room. We splurged for the large and it was pretty small. I can't even imagine how tiny the small room is if the large room that we paid more for was that size.

For a place that touts itself on its decor and calls itself the Hotel Modern, the room decor was not up to par. It was very minimalistic. Not minimalistic artsy, though; but minimalistic in a we-'re-trying-to-save-money-by-cutting-corners kind of way. A lot of the furniture and amenities were just really inefficient.

I think the bathroom was the worst part about the room -- there was no fan in there and the door was constantly closing so it couldn't even air itself out properly. I could tell it had been an ongoing problem because the paint on the ceiling was peeling off in really gross way. On our first day there, we made the mistake of showering and just leaving. At the end of the day, we came back and opened the bathroom door to a nasty musty smell with the mirror still all fogged up. Every day thereafter, we made sure to prop the door open before leaving.

It's not all bad though. As I mentioned earlier, most of the staff were very nice and we were greeted with lemon water when we walked in as well as by a cute red parrot who said """"Hello"""".  The lobby is very nicely decorated and I loved the dungeon-esque feeling of the elevator. What I appreciated about the room was the comfy bed, the iPod dock (only for pre-iPhone 5 devices), and the free wifi. There was also a cool bar and restaurant downstairs.

Location-wise, it wasn't bad either. When we first arrived, we were a little disappointed that there appeared to be nothing around us, but it turns out that we were right in the middle of a lot of cool stuff and just a 10 minute walk in ANY direction lead us to an entirely different part of that area of NOLA.

86,"Don't stay at Knights Inn in Nashville!

I got an Uber from my hotel room at about 7:35a on Saturday (2/15) and returned via Uber at about 4:12a this morning (2/16). (Yeah, I know. But, hey, a good time was had by all.)

Anyway, between these pick-up and drop-off times, I attended conference meetings at a downtown hotel, attended a boxing match, hung out at the hotel bar with conference attendees, and hung out in the hotel lobby.

When I returned to my room (125) this morning, the door was left ajar with the dead bolt; my luggage and belongings were tossed; somebody else's trash and clothes were discarded throughout the room; and my work-issued laptop, some of my clothes, most of my toiletries (!), and a bag containing my passport were missing.

When I reported the issue to hotel staff, the employee and security guard were largely apathetic and unsympathetic, and they claimed they would review the two security camera footage facing the door to my room. 

Early on in that process they said a man and a woman could be seen entering my room while I was gone (I think they said around 12p Saturday when I was at the conference downtown, but my memory is a little foggy about the exact time they initially stated.) Anyway, I know it was definitely during the time I was downtown.

After filing a report and doing a walkthrough of my room with a patrol officer, I requested to be moved to another room. 

Staff was not helpful with my request, so I had to clean up the room myself, throw out belongings that were either obviously and possibly used by my (ahem) visitor(s), so I could get a few hours of much-needed sleep. I had been assured by staff on duty that I would be fully reimbursed for at least one night's stay.

After catching a couple hours' sleep, I returned to the lobby to check out to go on a planned day trip. Not only was I now told that there was no footage showing someone else entering my room, but I was also informed that they were not authorized to provide a refund because I booked my stay with a third party (Expedia).

I just got off the phone with Expedia, and my Expedia rep said they were able to negotiate only a $100 refund from this hotel, instead of a full refund (about $320), because the staff claimed there was no evidence anyone had broken into my room and stolen my belongings. 

As you can tell, I'm pretty pissed about this facility's security lapses and their overall response to this situation. I just tried calling the lobby to talk with staff (again), but there was no answer.

Hence this review. I tried to go through the process without blasting them, but feel like this review is my only recourse at this point.

Fortunately, I'm staying at a different hotel in the area tonight. And unlike Knights Inn, this other hotel is concerned about its customer service and bumped up my allowed check-in time given the circumstances.

I stayed at this off-site hotel to save the organization I'm representing at the conference a little money.

Looks like I got what I paid for, don't make the same mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

93,"Went for the Santa brunch, at $40 per person I expected at least some different, more upscale type items to chose from. I was wrong - eggs, bacon, sausage, frozen potatoes, waffles and French toast that were hard as a rock, fries, chicken fingers, penne and some chicken dish. ALL of the food was cold, and what they had out was clearly sitting for a while. The atmosphere was nice, and the Santa and face painter/balloon lady were nice, as was the service, but the food was just so awful that I'll never go back. Server apologized and agreed with us that the selection was terrible, and that the food was cold, but still charged us full price. 3 adults and 1 child cost me $200 (inclusive of tip). I would have felt ripped off at $25 per person, $40 is just plain criminal. I always wanted to try this place, and it was extremely disappointing.

Separate them using commas. context: Went for the Santa brunch, at $40 per person I expected at least some different, more upscale type items to chose from. I was wrong - eggs, bacon, sausage, frozen potatoes, waffles and French toast that were hard as a rock, fries, chicken fingers, penne and some chicken dish. ALL of the food was cold, and what they had out was clearly sitting for a while. The atmosphere was nice, and the Santa and face painter/balloon lady were nice, as was the service, but the food was just so awful that I'll never go back. Server apologized and agreed with us that the selection was terrible, and that the food was cold, but still charged us full price. 3 adults and 1 child cost me $200 (inclusive of tip). I would have felt ripped off at $25 per person, $40 is just plain criminal. I always wanted to try this place, and it was extremely disappointing.

94,I was very disappointed with my recent stay here. I've been quite happy with SPG/Aloft hotels normally but this Aloft was just awful. The entire facility was poorly kept and generally dirty. The occupants of the neighboring room were up until the early morning (3am) smoking & drinking inside/outside their room. The staff conveyed overall apathy and did little to nothing as a result. Save yourself a headache and look for a better option if staying around here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

The hotel is literally in the middle of a business office--as in take an office building and build a hotel in the middle corridor. The view from my room?

I had to keep the curtains closed the entire time just because it gave me the creeps.

I was also given a handicapped room. Why??? I'm pretty sure this wasn't the only available room. Why would a hotel give an able bodied person a handicapped room?? Shouldn't those be reserved for handicapped people??

97,"*note* I wrote a similar review on tripadvisor.
I really wanted to like this hotel- it was charming and in a great location, with cute, unique rooms. It was just my style. Unfortunately, some blood-sucking insects ruined that.
Yup- bed bugs. We found them the morning we were leaving, because they normally come out very early in the morning (we were up at 530). Bleck! The management let us stay as long as necessary to take care of the issue (ie throwing away a bunch of our stuff and bagging the rest in ziplocks to be boiled) but it didn't change the fact that it was gross and a huge inconvenience. I threw away about $300 worth of clothing, shoes and luggage and I'm still worried that we brought the creatures back to our house with us. 
I would never stay here again, and I would urge you to think twice about it. Without seeing every carpet and mattress in the place replaced, there's no way I'd trust that the bugs were gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

98,"We scheduled massages and lunch for a special Christmas girls-day-out with my mother and sister-in-law, but we're not told that their spa facilities were most unusable and under construction.

106,"This is the best vacation I've had since becoming a parent! Really, it's true!!!

I just returned from a week at UCSB's Family Vacation, located on campus in Goleta, just 10 minutes North of downtown Santa Barbara. The campus is just gorgeous with well-groomed bike and walkways, and the beach, of course! The weather was perfect (low to high 70s). We stayed in the cluster portion of the San Rafael dorms. The clusters are 3-story buildings, whereas the tower (the main hub with a lobby, TV lounge, ping pong room) has seven floors. The rooms were clean with twin beds (which easily came together with a couple of bungee cords to become a king) and bathrooms with large showers (and a sitting area) and two sinks. I loved the storage space of the bedrooms (2 large closets with a chest of drawers as well). There was also a nice sitting room with a sofa, loveseat and 2 chairs, and a refrigerator, and outside balcony.

Here is why UCSB's FVC earns 5 stars and then some (in no particular order):

1) Staff/Camp counselors
We were greeted by the exuberant FVC staff upon our arrival. About 20 staff members yelled and cheered as they guided us into the parking lot, and then loaded huge blue bins on wheels with our luggage and walked up THREE flights of stairs to our room to unload it all while we checked in.

The staff is genuinely friendly and helpful. I appreciated their energy and enthusiasm for ensuring our vacation was just perfect. I heard staffers say over and over, ""We are here for you. You are on vacation""! The staff are mostly 20 somethings who are recent or current college students, mostly from UCSB. I found them to be exceptional - approachable, professional, fun, smart and talented. They are truly the creme de la creme. If I recall correctly, approximately 50 positions are filled from over 150 applications yearly. The staff could all dance and sing, and were obviously comfortable with and/or love children.

2) Location
Just a few hours away from LA and on the beach, people! The weather was mild and just warm enough.

Great dorm location - with a nice grassy lawn right out front, a short walk to the pool and dining area, lots of parking, and a few blocks to Isla Vista with fantastic coffee at Caje, delicious nachos at Freebirds and pizza from Woodstock. Late night fun at Dublin's and Sam's, too!

3) Food

We had most of our meals at the Carrillo Dining Commons. This is not your standard cafeteria. The meal options were amazing (organic fruits, desserts, various stations of hot entrees, salad bar, deli/cheeses; sodas, water, 4 different milks) and the menu changed daily. It was much more like a Las Vegas buffet, or going to a healthy food court. For you Moms and Dads out there...no prep, no clean up , and tons of choices = HEAVEN!

4) Staff

Oh, did I mention this already? The staff is amazing!!!

5) Activities

No one could ever be bored here. Hosted activities included Family Carnival (3 legged races, pie-eating contest, water balloon contest, temporary tattoos, delicious catered lunch), Margarita Pool night (free flowing margaritas and cocktails, hula hoop and limbo contests, hermit crab races), Casino Night (fancy hosted dinner at the Faculty Club, gambling with play money and dancing), Campfire sing-along and s'mores, Karaoke night (free flowing cocktails and night out with the staff in IV afterwards), and the Farewell show (the wonderful staff strutting their stuff and a video montage of pictures from the week). Other daytime activities included tennis, yoga, golf, wine country tours, softball game with staff vs. the vacationers, and much, much more!

6) Babysitting/Camp Counselors

We hired a babysitter so we could participate in the adult evening activities. The babysitters were staff members who also worked in the camp so our daughter felt really comfortable with them, and by the end of the the vacation, was begging for and yelling out their names at the Farewell Show. The babysitters were flexibile, and for the most part, came to our suite. However, I know other families who hired babysitters during the day, to take the kids swimming, or on an outing while the parents had some alone or ""me"" time.

Our daughter never cried, and was always happy and excited to see her ""teachers"". I am amazed about the bonds she forged with the staff. This is a testament to how wonderful these counselors truly are...their dedication to the kids and families was clearly evident.

We really got to connect with the staff because they went out of their way to say hello, to help, and to really be present for our family and the other guests.
Cheers to UCSB FVC...we'll see you next year!"

108,"I like the Clue game lookalike of this hotel. Respectful bell boys and valet drivers, bartenders delivering our drinks to our rooms quickly, phone etiquette with nice customer service, and my gf and I would come back to this hotel next year, great area, a little busy streets in downtown Boise. Coming from Cali, this service is phenomenal. Thank you guys. Watch your money spending here. Mine as well walk around and get cheaper foods to eat. The con's is no air vent in bathrooms especially of ours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

In the morning: Walked to the beach, rented kayaks, paddled through the mangroves and had a great lunch at Hook's (try the Key Lime Pie), Went swimming in a nice sized clean pool, sat in the hot tub and our server brought us drinks poolside.

111,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. 

The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. 

The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. 

The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!

Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

113,"We visited Wyndham La Belle Maison on a timeshare exchange.  The resort is lovely!  We had a one bedroom unit on the 6th floor.  It was clean and updated with huge floor-to-ceiling windows in the living/dining/kitchen area.  We had a terrible view - the parking garage of the Sheraton Hotel next door, but the unit was light.  The high ceilings made it seem much larger than it was.  There were no windows in the bedroom, but there were double French doors leading to the room with shutters that could open to let light in. The bathroom had door leading to both the bedroom and the living area.  The Exposed brick on the walls in the bedroom and living room accented the New Orleans decor. The bed was very comfortable, and the furnishings were in great shape. There was a sleeper sofa and a dining table that seats four.  At check in, we were asked if we needed a unit with a stove (this was not on our confirmation).  We had a refrigerator, microwave, sink and dishwasher. We did not plan to do any cooking, so we declined.  I don't know if there would have been an extra fee for this.
 We did not have a car, and we did not need one.  The 11 bus on Magazine street, right outside the resort, took us to the National World War II Museum (outstanding museum) and to the Audubon Zoo.  Canal street is only 2 blocks away and the trolley line is right there. It was an easy walk to Harrah's casino, the river, and the French Quarter.  The desk staff were very helpful and gave us suggestions on where to grab breakfast.  The breakfast/brunch place across the street, Ruby Slippers, always had a long wait so we did not go.   
The pool was very tiny, but we did see a family with 3 small children come up on the elevator with pool towels, so they got use out of it.  The ""spa"" was drained while we were there.  There is a small fitness center with a few commercial-grade machines.  The vending machine in there was out of order, as was the trash chute on our floor. 
There is a laundry room on the 7th floor with washers and dryers at no charge.  In the welcome basket in the unit were a couple of detergent packets, which was a nice touch.

114,"Nestled in the hills above Tucson This beautiful resort has so much to offer for a great family vacation (Hiking, Golf, Pool, Exercise room, Cycling & a nice Mexican Themed Bar & Grille). The rooms are large 1 & 2 bedroom casitas most with awesome views of Tucson at night. They all have small patios & a fireplace that burn real wood. A lot to see & do in the area.. minutes to the 10-fwy and about an hour to Tombstone or Nogales Mexico down the 19-fwy. We have stayed here several times & have found the staff very friendly. For those that golf.. they have one of the nicest around.

Now the Negatives.. they do not have Wi-Fi so we could not use all our devices. I hope they work on that as it would not be much trouble or expense with today's technology. They do however have a hardline you can plug into by the phone that is if you have a device with an Ethernet port.

They took no cleaner in to clean counters, bathroom, etc. Just nasty. Then they just looked in the microwave & fridge to see if it was clean. They didn't wipe nothing. I would never stay at this filthy mofo or any Econo Lodge. Just nasty. Go w/ a big brand like Marriot, Starwood or Hilton where customer satisfaction is part of their branding scope.

116,"So, I have never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel because well I live here and who cares. However, I am rating the lobby because even a non corporate, simple, no frills gal like me must give pause to a hotel that has a river with boat tours in it's lobby. 

All the plants are live, fountains with colored back lights, lovely trails, koi ponds, make this a must visit place even for locals. I like to go in the winter when it's cold out and I need to see some green. It definitely lifts my mood.

119,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room, the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.

After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.

I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!

Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.

Separate them using commas. context: I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room, the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.

After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.

I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!

Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.

120,Hotel is lovely. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We were lucky enough to get a room away from the club so we had no problem sleeping.

121,"Loved this hotel. 

I stayed for 4 days with my twin sons. It was clean, quiet, close to all the sights and everyone we encountered was very helpful.

This hotel is beautifully decorated, it features a nice inside courtyard with atrium and there is art work throughout---it isn't rundown and beat up like many of the other hotels. They have done a great job keeping this establishment in great shape.

We had no issue with street noise and we stayed on the second floor, on the Girod street side. Housekeeping did a great job freshening/cleaning the room everyday and my son's loved the rooftop pool each evening. They also have a very nice fitness room as well, and all the equipment was up to date and functioning and CLEAN.

We didn't dine in the hotel bar/restaurant, but it looked very good and there was often great aromas wafting into the common area when we walked by.

I brought my own mi-fi hotspot so I can't attest to the internet.

There's lots of things to do near the hotel that aren't the standard French Quarter sights. So, be sure to check them out. We enjoyed going to Fulton Alley one night during Happy Hour for some great family bowling and across the street there's BARCADIA which has loads of old school 80's video games and other cool games for patrons.

122,"Awesome place to get away for the weekend. The government rate for state or federal employees is a great deal if you qualify (that includes UA and military employees - so much of Tucson is covered!). 

However, keep in mind that the cheap government rate - often between $80 and $90, does NOT include the ""resort fee"", which is an additional $48 a night! Granted, you do get a lot of ""resort"" amenities to take advantage of. Included in the ""fee"" are access to the pools (a given) and a pretty fun waterslide, free use of the driving range and putting greens with a bag of clubs to use, mountain bikes and helmets to use, and the fitness center. There's also lots of nightly activities, like a ""mixology"" presentation at the bar (which is basically just the bartender describing how to make a drink and giving you about a shot worth of it for free). There's nightly stargazing on one of the lawns with a telescope and professional guide. On Saturday night they also had a ""dive in movie"" in the spa pool (it was ""Frozen""). 

Our total nightly cost per night was $148 after the resort fee and tax - the ""government rate"" base cost in that was $83. I'd still say its a great deal for what you get: a 5-star hotel, excellent service, and a great, relaxing experience. Just keep the resort fee in mind when you're making reservations.

Also, they tried to charge us $21 more for valet parking upon checkout, even though that is supposed to be included in the ""resort fee"". The moment I mentioned it to the front desk, they apologized and said it was ""a mistake"". However, if I had just done express checkout, as they encourage, I wonder if the $21 ""mistake"" would have stayed on the bill.

124,"When we moved south of Indianapolis from Chicago two years ago I wondered if we would find a place we liked as much as some of the lounges we enjoyed there. Once we stepped foot into Plat 99 I realized that we had found the place. Though a little pricey, the bar has elements that bring us back, and back, and back. The decor is gorgeous. I first encountered the bar in the winter where a group of girls met and took advantage of the huge windows and comfy couches inside. The glass lamps (I am told there are 99) are breathtaking. The drinks were amazing, albeit expensive, but worth it. The servers bring truffle oil popcorn. Oh yeah. It is as good as it sounds.

I had no idea that I could like the place more until I discovered the outdoor spring/summer space. The large outdoor area is perfect for sitting and enjoying the elements. The view is not fabulous, but endearing. The servers are fantastic...we soon got to know a few of them and they are so friendly and quick to greet you. They make your experience even better. This is the """"local plus"""" to me...the elegance of a upscale lounge with the midwestern hospitality. Fabulous.

125,"This hotel was fantastic. I was in town for a week, working at my company's PA office in Wayne. Great location and easy to get in and out. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was immaculately cleaned and very spacious for just one person. Kitchenette was fully stocked with dishes, silverware, utensils, a small dishwasher and a full size fridge. Windows surrounding the king size bed were great- lots of natural light. I liked that opting out of housekeeping got me a $5 credit at the restaurant. 

The pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub. The bar has a decent drink selection, although I was bummed they were out of mint and couldn't make a mojito (which was on the drink menu). Burger was okay. Dessert was mediocre (but free with my $5 credit, so nbd). Omelet station was a nice touch in the AM.

128,"This is my favorite place to stay on St. Pete Beach (SPB). The pool isn't big time, so let's get that out of the way. But this is the real deal old school family run smallish Florida motel type ""resort"" experience right on St Pete Beach. Plenty of tiki huts, laundry facilities, shuffleboard, hammocks, games, toys, mini-mini golf course, etc packed into this place. Plus a library and happy hour room. Friendly staff. Homey. And kitchens with Publix and Walgreen's across the street and full sized fridge / freezers for your leftovers and ice. :) Even a shade spot little beach bar hut and Chik File A room food service.. As well as other delivery places. Keep it local peeple. 

There's a dock across the street at their sister property on the I tercoadtal (and I believe they even loan fishing gear..), their rooms are well appointed for families with kitchen gear, utensils, strainer etc. so you can eat in, and the partial beach and full beach views are pretty bad ass. 

It's a fairly quiet section of Beach between the Don and public beach area and the more crowded Spring Break section up by Tradewinds to the north. 

This is NOT a five star fancy hotel with big time frou frou decor and amenities. It's a Florida family vacation getaway spot to relax and enjoy special time with your loved ones in spacious and comfy home style rooms. If you know how to embrace that kind of experience there is no greater romance. :)

The owner, Rob, is a super nice guy and involved in the community. There isn't really room service but they have a delivery set up with Chik Fil A from across the street. No joke. It's little things like this that, if you know how to enjoy them, will make you appreciate this St Pete gem. Just know it's not going to perfect or ultra-luxury. It's going to be comfortable and will provide the perfect setting for you and yours to explore and enjoy the beach, kick back and relax, and be free from any kind of snobbery or attempts to keep up with the Joneses. 

You can walk to EVERYTHING including Publix right across the street. So you have loads of options for restaurants or you can keep it simple and cook something (if you book one of their suites with kitchen area), or just order in.

131,"I will never ever stay anywhere else in Tampa! I stayed in the Villa's which is not apart of the hotel. First I was very upset when they told me I was not staying in the hotel and I would be shuttled to this off shore part. She assured me however I would be very pleased, and boy was I! These Villa's are stunning (2018) is where I stayed and I just fell in love. Now there are two pools on site! I consider the pool that's connected to the hotel and family pool. It has a hot tub and is a little more for those who are not trying to mingle. The other pool is what I would consider the ""cool"" pool. In my eyes, not for kids, but there were kids there! This area people are tending to really enjoy, drink, relax and tan. More cocktails seem to flow on this side which is great, awesome music and love the fact that you can smoke cigars here. You can order cigars from your server, they have a few to choose from. Very interesting that they do not have torches to buy, but they do bring you a little pack of matches. So if you are in the cigar mood, make sure to bring a lighter! Plenty of towels provided, so grab a few and relax. The bar area opens around 10:30 I believe. They start setting up around 10am so if you are in the mood to start early, you can bring a little something from your room. There's an area out where you can play corn-hole, ping pong, rent jets and more! In addition a cool little area were if fishing is your thing, bring your rods and do so! The beds were very comfortable, however I got bug bites which made me upset, but I know they will go away. They tore my upper legs up pretty bad which I did see until I arrived back at home. Very safe environment! There is a hotel shuttle to pick you up and bring you back to the airport (complimentary) And if you cannot get a late check out, the bellman will check your luggage and you can still use all the amenities on site. Every dollar worth is because there are simply no problems.

I will always stay here - 
I did not want to leave -
Every single dollar worth it- 
All kids were well behaved (this is still more of adult hotel) -
Cleaning staff was super nice and professional -
Never touched one door when I arrived & left (bellman stayed right at the front at all times)

First I was very upset when they told me I was not staying in the hotel and I would be shuttled to this off shore part. She assured me however I would be very pleased, and boy was I! These Villa's are stunning (2018) is where I stayed and I just fell in love. Now there are two pools on site! I consider the pool that's connected to the hotel and family pool. It has a hot tub and is a little more for those who are not trying to mingle. The other pool is what I would consider the ""cool"" pool. In my eyes, not for kids, but there were kids there! This area people are tending to really enjoy, drink, relax and tan. More cocktails seem to flow on this side which is great, awesome music and love the fact that you can smoke cigars here. You can order cigars from your server, they have a few to choose from. Very interesting that they do not have torches to buy, but they do bring you a little pack of matches. So if you are in the cigar mood, make sure to bring a lighter! Plenty of towels provided, so grab a few and relax. The bar area opens around 10:30 I believe. They start setting up around 10am so if you are in the mood to start early, you can bring a little something from your room. There's an area out where you can play corn-hole, ping pong, rent jets and more! In addition a cool little area were if fishing is your thing, bring your rods and do so! The beds were very comfortable, however I got bug bites which made me upset, but I know they will go away. They tore my upper legs up pretty bad which I did see until I arrived back at home. Very safe environment! There is a hotel shuttle to pick you up and bring you back to the airport (complimentary) And if you cannot get a late check out, the bellman will check your luggage and you can still use all the amenities on site. Every dollar worth is because there are simply no problems.

I will always stay here - 
I did not want to leave -
Every single dollar worth it- 
All kids were well behaved (this is still more of adult hotel) -
Cleaning staff was super nice and professional -
Never touched one door when I arrived & left (bellman stayed right at the front at all times)
Tips are always a good thing, so have some cash (there is an ATM available)
Nice hotel store if you are needing anything last minute-
There is no reason to leave this property-- Everything you need is here!"
132,"Ash Mill farm was the most quaint, charming and relaxing bed and breakfast. My boyfriend and I took a spur of the moment trip to New Hope and wanted to stay at a B&B.

133,"We loved our stay here! We will go back for sure! If you don't have kids there are places at the resort, like the adult only pool, down at the beach and in many of the bars where you can have a more peaceful time. If you do have kids, like we do, this place is awesome for keeping the whole family entertained. Many of the activities are now included in the room resort fee. The kids loved, loved, loved the huge water slide and the line was no more than 5 minutes. The paddle boats were a big hit too and there are plenty of them so there typically wasn't a wait. My kids also enjoyed the free mini golf as well as playing chess with the jumbo pieces. For $8 they got to do the big trampoline for 5 minutes and that was a huge hit. If your kids are going to do that you might want to consider having them do it earlier in the day because after dinner the line gets long. 

There are so many dining choices there so everyone should be happy. It definitely has resort pricing but we found a way around that. Our room had a full kitchen that was outfitted with everything we needed to prepare our meals in room (no dishwasher but dish soap and drying rack were there). 

Our room was awesome. Not only was it very nicely decorated and updated, but it was also large with a separate bedroom with two beds, and a living room/kitchen area that overlooked the beach with a direct view (none of this straining your neck to see water). It had a small deck that held two chairs and a table. It also had a pull out bed in the couch, so technically it could sleep 6. The bathroom was really nice too and the water pressure was fantastic and got hot nicely. 

The resort has also taken some measures to save energy and one caught us off guard. If the sliding glass door is opened (or not closed all the way) the AC shuts off to save electricity. Because we hadn't shut it properly when coming back in from enjoying our view we thought the AC was broken. I called the front desk and the woman told me exactly what the most likely problem was and stayed on the phone with me while I checked. Once I closed the door fully the AC clicked right back on. 

Check in was slower than I would have liked (like a 10 minute wait) but because we were trying to check in a few hours early our room wasn't ready right then. We did however get a call about 15 minutes after that saying we could pick up our key, so that was a bonus. Also the guard gate to get on the resort can be slow sometimes.

Overall I would highly recommend Tradewinds if you love the beach because it is truely beautiful there.

134,"I stayed at the Orange St location from Friday to Monday.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.

Overall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes. I forgot to mention how quiet** this place is. I loved it. I felt as if no one was there except me. Very quiet* which worked for me on Sunday bc I had lots of studying to do and two TV's to watch The Walking Dead on. Lol! I would most definitely stay here again. Very spacious and updated. Loved it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

135,"This hotel is a gem in the heart of Philadelphia.

It's a cozy, quaint, and charming property. The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. 
The decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. 

Free breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. 

Coffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say ""good morning"" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.

I've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...

A few things to note:
Its location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. 

There's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)

Don't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!

Overall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

143,"On a recent trip to Port Richey, I selected Holiday Inn Express for a couple of reasons. The main reason was the option of two beds (as I was sharing the room with my brother). The other reasons were: price, vicinity to my aunt's home and complementary breakfast. 

My family and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place/House when we're traveling. However, since it was just my brother and I, I figured we'd give Holiday Inn a shot. 

+ The staff were very friendly and helpful.

+ Breakfast was very good, offering both hot and cold entrees. 

- Sadly, the beds were WAY TOO soft. It felt as if the mattresses were past their life expectancy. As a result, I didn't really sleep well for most of my three nights there.
- The a/c was hit and miss with the lack of reliable thermostat controls. 

There was a pool and hot tub, but since I didn't utilize either, it wouldn't be fair to rate them. There also a small gym that I didn't use either.

Separate them using commas. context: On a recent trip to Port Richey, I selected Holiday Inn Express for a couple of reasons. The main reason was the option of two beds (as I was sharing the room with my brother). The other reasons were: price, vicinity to my aunt's home and complementary breakfast. 

My family and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place/House when we're traveling. However, since it was just my brother and I, I figured we'd give Holiday Inn a shot.

144,"We had a good stay overall despite small problems through out the stay and I would return. We stayed here for two nights, our first night we arrived early morning, we decided to park in the Mansion house. First of all the garage is a bit confusing if you've never been and hard to find an exit to walk out of ( we learned to park near the entrance if possible so we could walk out through there than go through the side stairs that smelled of urine or ""pissy stairs"" as we called them)but alas you get what you pay for so I didnt' expect much more than to save $. When we got checked in the lady checking me in wasn't very personable but wasnt rude or anything, maybe it was due to us being there at 5 am, not many people are awake at that time. As we got in the elevator to go upstairs the power went out and of course I wanted to get out since the elevators doors had closed and I thought we were stuck, but all I did was push the help button and the elevator doors opened and I was extremely relieved. Of course once the elevators were back up I was a little scared to ride it up to our floor but I did fine. The common areas of the hotel were nicely done, very classy and the room was nicely decorated, up to date, and we had a partial arch view. Same day but much later.....our room wasn't cleaned when we arrived after being out the whole day so we were a little disappointed in that but all it needed was to have the beds made so it wasnt a big deal. Our second night I will have to say I saw an influx of people, seemed like a lot of college or baseball fans, one or the other. That night we were woken up by someone pounding on a door and shouting to be let in, I thought someone was surely trying to break in. It was our lovely neighbors who were having some kind of lovers quarrel, three guys trying to get back in their hotel room and a mad girlfriend not letting them in or something along those lines. My bf went out and set them straight and they left. Well I finally dozed off and again we hear this damn pounding loud enough to wake us up, I guess guy is finally allowed in but I still call front desk. Third time woken up is when security knocks on their door and they come out and speak so freaking loud I wake up again. Fourth time I hear a large group of girls and guys shouting. laughing, and interacting with the idiot next door. If it wouldnt have lasted less then a couple minutes security would have been called again. The rest of the night was fine but dealing with this definately put a damper on my night. The next day when we checked out we explained the situation and security had the info to back it all up. We were given a credit to one of their restaurants so I appreciated their effort since they didnt have any control over their rowdy guests. Overall the hotel was in a nice location, great rooms, not such great neighbors if you get the college crowd, but overall since I got a deal on priceline I'd say it was a good place to stay and would return.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

145,"Solid, inexpensive hotel located close to various museums, including the National World War Two museum, the French Quarter, the business district, the garden district, the city park, Layette Square and innumerable other Nawlins attractions. This is much nicer than a budget hotel, but the prices should meet many budgets. They have breakfast included, along with snacks and a modest late afternoon snack/dinner, PLUS free happy hour! That's right, three free drinks to start your night right, including wine, beer and real mixed drinks/cocktails.

146,"Such a pleasant surprise! My fiancee and I booked a room through Hotel Tonight at the last minute and were exhausted from a long day of driving on PCH. We were welcomed by very friendly front desk staff, warm fresh chocolate chip cookies, coffee, juice, and candy. It is extremely clean consistently throughout the Inn ( which is very important ).... obviously. They are very accommodating to basic comforts, such as a couples jacuzzi?! Yes we actually had a fully functional, cute jacuzzi in our suite. We also had a fireplace and delicious homemade breakfast INCLUDED, which is obviously a plus in my book. The Inn has very nice Spanish details throughout. Overall, they cover the basics and then some!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.

147,"I was skeptical at first. We did not know what to expect. However, the place was amazing. Our room was upgraded to a suit. The hotel is in an old warehouse type building and is connected to a museum. Admission to the Museum is included. There is art and really cool features throughout the hotel. Everything is very contemporary and beautiful. The Door guy/ Bell Hop Greg (looks like James Brown, but younger) was very helpful. He would not allow us to do anything, he did it all. He unload our vehicle, took us to our room, with a little tour and even put our luggage away. The front desk staff was very pleasant and nice. 

The hotel seems more like a Boutique hotel, no pool or hot tub. There is a nice looking restaurant and bar. We saw people from outside the hotel going there, so it must be good. The hotel seems to be pricey, 300 plus. If it wasn't for Hotwire, we probably couldn't have afforded it. The location was perfect. Just a few blocks from Broadway where all of the Honky Tonks are and just down the street from the Wild Horse Saloon.",,"museum, admission",,,"Broadway, Honky Tonks, Wild Horse Saloon","museum, admission","museum, admission",The hotel is connected to a museum.

148,"I stayed at the Orange St location from Friday to Monday.

Arrival: I already read plenty of reviews about no signs marking the location therefore, I looked for Starbucks. I parked in a spot in front of the multi business complex. I went inside to find a guard at a desk that said we have been contracted to hand guests their keys and room number and nothing more. He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.

The Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.
There wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.

Overall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes. I forgot to mention how quiet** this place is. I loved it. I felt as if no one was there except me. Very quiet* which worked for me on Sunday bc I had lots of studying to do and two TV's to watch The Walking Dead on. Lol!  I would most definitely stay here again. Very spacious and updated. Loved it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hotel review, list aspects that are atypical for a hotel.
