From the reception to the haircut, the salon is customer focused and takes precautions to ensure safety for all.

2,"I purchased the Groupon for a cut and highlight. The highlight came out good but the cut was horrible. The hairdresser asked me what length I wanted but nothing else about the style (layers, angles, anything like that). She only cut my hair dry and never touched it up once wet. When I got home I realized one side of my hair was at least half an inch longer than the other, it was very very noticeable. 

I called the salon and they offered to fix it free of change. The owner did my cut the second time and he was wonderful, very talented and also friendly. I'm happy it was fixed but do wish I didn't have to get it fixed in the first place. 

Overall I'd suggest going to the salon but being particular about your hairdresser and don't be afraid to say exactly what you want if they don't ask.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

3,"Although I do think $20 (not including tip) is too much to pay for a 2 year old boy hair cut, I was impressed with this place. My son who normally is kicking and screaming when it comes to buzzers hesitantly sat in the firetruck and got his hair cut. It had a working pedal, sirens and he even had the choice to watch whatever on his own tv at the station. When he started to get upset they turned a bubble machine on and gave him a lollipop. Kids also have the option to pick out a balloon on the way out. The place is nicely decorated and really well thought out catering to children.","firetruck, working pedal, sirens, his own tv, bubble machine, lollipop, balloon",,,,"firetruck, working pedal, sirens, his own tv, bubble machine, lollipop, balloon","A kid sat in the firetruck and got his hair cut.

4,"This place is all new and although its something not normally associated with ""bikers"", they are making a push to bring us into their world. They've been at the last couple of events at Some Other Place including Wednesday night ""Bike Nights"". They are organizing an upcoming Sunday for bikers only. This is a day they are not normally open at all. Just give them a call and tell them what Sunday you'd be willing to give them some love. Men, your ladies will appreciate it (brownie points) and if you think they don't have anything for us, you'd be wrong. Who wouldn't benefit from a massage! When you call ask for Lenora!

6,"Bliss Elements salon is one of my favorite places in Delaware. Though I only like about 7 things in Delaware, this is still high praise! Here are the main highlights (in no particular order):

1. Bliss Elements is a ""green"" salon, meaning that it's owners are environmentally-conscious. I can't verify how ""green"" the salon's operations are, but they do make and sell all-natural haircare products. As I transition to natural hair, it's especially important for me to use chemical-free hair products.

2. This is Black owned and operated business; a rarity, especially in a state lacking diversity.

3. The salon's earth tone decor and wood floors create a classy, clean, and welcoming environment. I also appreciate the complimentary tea, coffee, wine, snacks, and wifi.

4. I got a few sew-in weaves there and I loved them. I brought my own hair, and LaRee sewed it in with a net. I love nets because they last longer, don't move around on your scalp, and look neater. I haven't been there in a year, but last summer sew-ins cost $135.

With all of these accolades, you're probably wondering why I only gave this salon 4 stars. Well, here it is: the manicurist/pedicurist turnover rate is insane! I see a different one each time I go there! The girls that worked there about a year and half ago were AMAZING. I can't speak to the current manicurist/pedicurist. This might not matter to some people, but I like building a rapport with the people who handle my beauty procedures.",manicurist/pedicurist,,,,manicurist/pedicurist,The salon has a manicurist/pedicurist.,,,,The salon has a manicurist/pedicurist.,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

7,"I only go to this hair salon for my haircuts. I've been getting my haircuts by Jason for many, many, many years. I used to live in Las Vegas & would fly to Philly to see Jason for my haircuts & see my family. Jason, the man got MAD skills & works magic with his scissors. I've NEVER leave the salon dissatisfied. My whole family only goes to him too for their haircuts. 

The wait is not so bad and if you do have to wait, it's WORTH the wait. The prices are reasonable. For female wash, cut, and style it's about $25. This is a fair amounts I would pay for my haircuts for someone like myself who have long & thick hairs. I just LOVE LOVE the way Jason layers & thin out the thickness of my hairs and make my head feel lighter.

8,"Read the filtered reviews too - they are 4 and 5 for this salon! 

I've been here three times and each time was great. I typically go to small business salons, and finding Sandra is awesome. She asks what you want and is very careful in how she cuts my hair to ensure the cut and blow dry is great, taking her time to make sure the style is perfect. During each visit, she's told me about conditioning or packages that have saved me money. My husband goes to Erika and has had a good haircut each time too. The salon is festive, the stylists all talk to the customers and each other, which make customers feel welcome. Walking in without an appointment (especially trying to make an appointment at nearby salons for the same week is impossible), and paying $32 for a blow dray and cut is a bargain (again nearly $50 to 100 at nearby salons). I would show the stylists a picture or take one with your phone, so they know what you expect. My husband and I are busy professionals, so being able to walk in for a haircut is awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

It's very inviting, warm, and bright; everything you would want from a salon. It is the perfect location; walking distance from work and near all of the fun restaurants and bars. I thought the prices were reasonable too. I had a groupon, but even the regular pricing was pretty standard/reasonable. The staff is so nice and helpful. Their signature soap store is on the first/bottom level, the salon on the second, and the yoga studio on the third. It's such a fun setup. My stylist was Kensey and she was very attentive to the cut and color I wanted and spent a lot of time getting it just right. I tend to be indecisive and she was helpful in getting me to make a decision about length and color! She used their signature Bark shampoo and conditioner which smells AMAZING and does not leave any type of build up in your hair. I bought both on my way out because it's that great. I am so happy with the way my hair turned out - I haven't had a cut I like in a really long time. I will definitely be a regular client of D&L and Kensey!

14,"Christy one of the co-owners of Ciao has been doing my hair for several years. I have straight, fine, naturally blonde hair. Christy has cut it in varying overall lengths and amount of layers as I tried differing styles - from bobs to below shoulder length, bangs or not. Christy has consistently given me cuts to complement my lifestyle, hair and face so that my hair is easy care, healthy and shiny. She also does my highlights (foil method) so that they blend with my natural color but brighten it up. She is careful to choose the strengths and colors so that as my hair grows they continue to appear very natural over at least 8 weeks. If I can make the time, she schedules in between haircuts/highlights bang trims. 
I have seen her work on many clients with all sorts of hair and styles and have never seen a bad cut. By their greetings and how she's booked, it's clear that most clients stick with her once they find her. 
The salon itself is a calm and welcoming, and meticulously clean. There's parking up a little driveway behind the salon or for treatments less than 90 minutes there's usually street parking (even though Trader Joe's is right up the street). There's always a new art show on the walls and often handcrafted jewelry, handbags and/or jewelry to purchase if you like (right now the jewelry is gorgeous). Ciao also carries all sorts of quality hair products which they sell for good prices.","handcrafted jewelry, handbags, jewelry",new art show,,,"new art show, handcrafted jewelry, handbags, jewelry","The salon has handcrafted jewelry, handbags and/or jewelry to purchase.",The salon has art on the walls.,,,"The salon has art on the walls and handcrafted jewelry, handbags and/or jewelry to purchase.","Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

15,"I discovered The Beauty Lounge through a great Groupon offer that included full highlights, cut, and Moroccan oil treatment. Convenient location on Main Street in the Carmel Arts & Design District. Services provided include full hair services, eyelash extensions, make-up, manicures, and spray tanning. 

I like the atmosphere at The Beauty Lounge. It's modern, tidy, and uncluttered. Some product is available, but it doesn't feel like you're stepping into a Beauty Supply store. The Beauty Lounge is all about your beauty experience. There's a calm, zen-feel to this space... as a matter of fact, I think there's a small yoga class hosted upstairs. This offers the unspoken message regarding the care of inner beauty, too.

Eva Harris is the head stylist. She's very professional and her experience includes celebrity photo shoots and being named an Indy Monthly Top Stylist. I would feel intimidated and uncomfortable in an overly chi-chi salon. Beauty Lounge is chic yet welcoming and comfortable. Eva listened to my hair goals and I'm really pleased with my new highlights. I should have taken a pic as soon as I left the salon...

Sounds like they have a new eyelash extension offer on Groupon. Overheard the receptionist explaining that they use medical-grade adhesive for the healthiest hold and long wear. Also, I've seen some photos of Eva's hair & make-up styling and would highly recommend her for a special event or bridal party services.

16,"Such an amazing space. Guaranteed - you will become just a little bit cooler and more stylish from even just walking into the place. Not only is the environment and decor inspiring - from the photography on the walls to the vintage furniture everywhere, but they also sell all kinds of things that you're going to want to buy.

17,"I was looking for a solution to tame my frizz not wanting to go the keratin route and ended up booking the phyto relaxer treatment here thinking it's just a smoothing treatment. I know, stupid me! My appointment was booked with Drea, the master stylist here. One look at my hair and she said I don't need to go the relaxer route. I just need some deep conditioning to hydrate my hair. I'm glad she just gave me good advice without trying to upsell treatments. The entire process took almost an hour and I just walked out of the salon with smooth nicely blow dried hair. Thanks Drea for understanding my attempt of reducing chemicals and unnecessarily stressing my hair.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

18,"Yesterday was my first visit to Paris Parker. I have never gone to a stylist that didn't come with a recommendation in my life until now. I was short on time and wanted to go somewhere near my home.

They told me I would see Stacey for my full highlight appointment. 

She was awesome!

She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. 

Blonde hair isn't easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.

Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours. 

Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :)",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

19,"Today was haircut day yay! One of my favorite days ever. I just realized that I haven't reviewed J Bangs Salon, where I've been going to Morgan for about the past year (I had to switch from my previous, VERY expensive salon when I suddenly decided to stop hemmoraging money). Actually, she cut my hair at another place, then she moved to J Bangs so I followed...

For the salon as a whole, it's decent--pretty small, but tidy and trendy. I used to think what annoyed me about other locations was the hip staff all dressed in black, and acted too cool for school. J Bangs isn't like that, but THAT kind of annoys me now. Like, is this place not that cool or something? Anyway, clearly this could be a weird issue of my own I need to deal with!

Much more important than the actual building and decor is the stylist...and I love Morgan! She does a great cut and color, for less than half what I used to pay at my old place. I get so many more compliments on my hair these days! 

I give the salon 3 stars because it's just fine. Really, go there for the stylist--Morgan! I would give HER 5 stars!",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

21,"One of the nicest salons I have ever been to. I loved the interior design and the wide selection of refreshments. The pricing was very fair got what I received. This is the best haircut I have had in a very long time. If also helps that is walking distance from my apartment, and they were also hosting a blanket drive, and I love when businesses are involved in the local community.

There are two reasons this isn't a five star review: first, the online system on which you book appointments is clunky and often doesn't load correctly. I wasn't sure if my appointment was confirmed until the next day. Secondly, my appointment started almost half an hour late, making my haircut take much longer than normal.","blanket drive, local community",,,,"blanket drive, local community","The salon was hosting a blanket drive, and is involved in the local community.",,,,"The salon was hosting a blanket drive, and is involved in the local community.","Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

23,"Salon Salon is housed in the original train depot building which was built in 1907. I believe it was restored in 1941 to Spanish Colonial style. It is also part of the National Register. So entering it you can feel the old embracing the newness of the interior design that now occupies the space. I've been following Jessica for the last couple of years because in my humble opinion I think she is really in a class by herself with her eye for color and style. Besides all that she is so incredibly warm and welcoming. I think opening this new place has been a life long dream. She has accomplished what she set out for. Downtown Tucson is now seeing a Renaissance that our community so deserves. Salon Salon is just a little bit down from Maynard's so it's easy to park. You can grab a bite and get your beauty needs all done in one clean sweep. The inside of the shop is amazingly stylish with a center huge wall with live greenery hanging by inner clips. You think you are looking at a painting and it is alive. Never seen anything like it. Also, she has some cases of beautiful affordable jewelry placed in the shop. In the rear there is a door leading out to the back which will be used to hold lectures, meetings, etc. It faces the train track.  I was lucky enough to see a train leaving for parts unknown. You can also have mani pedis, waxing room, etc. We are so lucky to live in Tucson and see the growth of our Downtown bring new life here once again.","beautiful affordable jewelry, shop, mani pedis, waxing room","original train depot building, National Register, live greenery",,,"original train depot building, National Register, live greenery, beautiful affordable jewelry, shop, mani pedis, waxing room","The salon has some cases of jewelry placed in the shop.

24,It was my first time here and Rosa definitely took amazing care of me and my hair. My hair was in need of a major haircut from all the damage its been through from dying. She first asked me how I wanted my hair cut and gave me opinions on it. She worked with what I wanted and that's what I truly appreciated. She talked to me the whole process so I felt comfortable. Booked online which was quick and easy. Will be back in 3 months or even less for trims and treatments!,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

27,"I totally agree with the review submitted by Taylor G.
I thought I'm the only with that experience. Now it confirms that this salon needs good professional etiquette..

I made my first appointment with Amy for a haircut , color and highlight . You would think she will WOW new client with promptness and enthusiasm, right? WRONG!!... She replied to me after 3 text messages and numbers of calls to her cellphone and landline. (But i am a very patient person by nature , so no big deal) iFinally she texted me back telling me someone cancelled and can take me in ( oh wow thank you!!!). She came in 15 min late in the salon on my first appointment... (it's a turn off , but no big deal) . For me, as long as the hairstylist will do a good job and will make me feel happy with my hair... all other things are negligible. Unfortunately, my haircut was BAD and i was not happy with the result of my highlight. She offered me to come back to redo the highlights .... but when i called back again after few days.... she never returned any of my voicemails and text messages and completely ignored me. What she did to my hair ( shaving the back of my hair unevenly ) was very frustrating , but because I am a very nice person and thinking it was both our first time ... i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe the second time around will turn out better.... but i was so disappointed how she treated and ignored me. No professional etiquette.

28,"I went in for a deva cut and instead, soon as I sat down Lana started combing through and stretching my curls out with her fingers and nails - first red flag. Then she did the same when she washed my hair, stretched it all out - multiple red flags and it was at this point that I knew I wasn't gone get what I paid for. She couldn't even use a microfiber cloth let alone the right way. Then she said she won't put much product in and she'd use lightweight product. I thought that was smart until she dumped half the bottle and ran it through my hair and scalp, all while still stretching my curls and saying """"I'm putting a little more in now so when you wake up in the mornings and you just wet it and it activates the product and you can do that for days"""" (hundreds of red flags. I knew she had no clue what the hell she was doing)... She had me sit under the dryer just 5 mins after washing my hair dried out my whole head before sitting me in the chair and telling me I actually don't need to cut much off even though I see the split ends and I told her to. Then while she cut she pulled and stretched and combed out every curl to where it was damn near straight. To top that off, the half bottle of product made my scalp greasy and made my hair stringy. 

Girl don't know what a devacut and shampoo is let alone any other curly hair care. Not a single thing she did is supposed to be done to curly hair. 

Then I cancelled my color appointment in less than 24 hours cause I wasn't about to pay her $300 to destroy my hair and she asked for $25... I looked all over their website and not once did it say anything about cancellation fees. I didn't pay her though.

The esthetic has a very relaxing gypsy vibe with beautifully mismatched furniture and exposed brick. I was a fan of the bowl of candy they had in the waiting area. 

I can't remember my hair dresser's name but she was very nice and helpful. I left it in her hands to decide which color to highlight hair and I'm so happy I did that. She suggested I go for a more golden blonde tone because my current color was washing me out. All of the products she used smelled SO good and I left a very happy camper.

35,"BJ's hair shop has been like family to me. I've been seeing them for 8+ years, and I haven't looked back. They are hands-down the best barbershop in town and the biggest supporters of our community. The atmosphere, the quality of haircuts, and the free beer/coffee are great - but it's the people that make it so special. Here's a little story: I first met Mari and Doris at UNR when they so graciously came to shave people's heads to help fundraise for St. Baldrick's cancer foundation. They shaved over 50+ people's heads and we raised $1,000's to donate for cancer patients. Then they came back to UNR once more and helped to run another philanthropy, a men's fashion show, which I participated in. It was called ""Mr. GQ"" and again, we raised money for a good cause - this time to help feed the hungry. They gave all the contestants free haircuts! A couple of years later, and after seeing these ladies every couple of months, I was helping to raise money for the Nevada Men's Soccer team... I felt like I should ask Doris if she would be willing to help - yep! They donated over $500 to our Nevada Men's Club Soccer program!!!! This helped us to buy new jerseys. Finally, when I got into medical school, these fine people helped fund an international medical mission for me - not once, but twice! Besides being cheerful, talented, and easy-going they are the kindest group of people you've ever met. Go on, bring your business here and You. Will. Not. Regret it. If you're visiting - this will be a nice spot to check out before going downtown. If you're a local, you should make it a point to pop in on the reg, grab a beer from their mini-fridge and kick it with Doris, Mari and all the awesome people here. 10/10 would recommend this place to anybody - guy or gal. They are the best.

THANK YOU BJ'S for being genuinely GREAT!!! You will be missed dearly when I have to find a barber in a new city - don't worry I'll be back ;) .","St. Baldrick's cancer foundation, another philanthropy, hungry, free haircuts, Nevada Men's Club Soccer program, international medical mission",,,,"St. Baldrick's cancer foundation, another philanthropy, hungry, free haircuts, Nevada Men's Club Soccer program, international medical mission","The salon helped fundraise for St. Baldrick's cancer foundation.

37,"Lots of good things about this place, but almost as many not so good things. I continue to take my youngest child there because of the experience it offers, but I do it every time kicking and screaming. And if she were a boy (meaning, needing more frequent haircuts as opposed to the twice per year my daughter needs) then I'd definitely find somewhere else. 

The pros: The inside is bright, cheerful, and clean. They do appointment times, which I wish I had noticed before. As you walk in, they have a play area to the right where you can wait, along with some video games hooked up to TV's on the other side for older kids. While the kids get their hair cut, they can choose to sit in a regular seat, or a taxi, firetruck, or race car. They can also choose which DVD they'd like to watch, and there's quite an assortment of Disney and Nickelodeon favorites. They can also opt to play a video game. Win for wiggly kids. If that's not enough, they have toys in the drawer for your child to play with (although, I will pass, I don't want my kid touching something that's been handled by other peoples' crying, drooling, snotty children). The employees are usually very nice, and you can sit very near to your child while they get their trim. When finished, kids get a lollipop, and if it's their first haircut they even give you a keepsake card to put their first trim into. 

Now, the cons. Price. Just a basic cut, no shampoo or style, and not even a full blow dry will run you about $18. They do have some sort of rewards program, but I've yet to reap any rewards from this so called rewards program. The wait. I arrived at 3:45pm on a Monday after school, with no one in the waiting area. Two kids were having their hair cut by two employees that work there. An hour later, we were finally seated and getting ready to get our trim. They took people with an appointment ahead of everyone else, which is great if you have an appointment. But this place really wasn't THAT busy, so I'm not sure what the deal was. Next con is the toys. No, not the toys for them to play with because that's great and keeps their attention. The toys near the checkout. Like, say Johnny really enjoyed playing with Thomas the Train, well, low and behold there's a packaged Thomas ready to go right by the checkout! I can only imagine the nightmares some parents are faced with. But then again, if bribery is your route, this might be a pro for you (although I'm sure the prices are ridiculous). Lots of hairbows and other things for sale, as well, and hair products, of course. 

If your kid is happy and well-behaved for a regular haircut, take them to a regular old place. But if you have a fidgety child that dislikes the haircutting experience, give this place a try.","play area, video games, regular seat, taxi, firetruck, race car, DVD, Disney, Nickelodeon favorites, video game, lollipop, keepsake card, toys",,,,"play area, video games, regular seat, taxi, firetruck, race car, DVD, Disney, Nickelodeon favorites, video game, lollipop, keepsake card, toys","The salon has a play area along with some video games for older kids.

38,"BLue is definitely an INCREDIBLE salon. The stylists are very friendly, and more importantly, they are all very talented (not just in hair, but in other areas as well! a few of the stylists are musicians), skilled, creative, and dedicated to continuing their education. The atmosphere is great too; the decor is very artsy and vintage--my kind of style, I often run into people I know as well as meet other clients while I'm there. BLue also has custom-blended coffee specially made for them by a coffee shop right up the road and features live jazz music on Saturday afternoons, which is great to listen to while you're waiting for your appointment or waiting for your color to process. 

Aside from the best in cutting, coloring, and styling, BLue also offers makeup, waxing, skin care treatments, massages, a small clothing boutique called JennK, and a men's lounge with plasma TVs and a pool table. 

I would HIGHLY recommend BLue to anyone!

48,"I went in not too long ago to see a stylist named kayla who that i heard did good hair. 
not sure if she was having a bad day but to me she seemed like a sweet girl at first but that turned into her speaking poorly about her other clients. as she is speaking about her clients she is taking away time from actually paying attention to my hair color. she proceeds to then speak about ""caitlyn jenner"" and if anyone knew about this public figure its a sensitive subject, I really felt uncomfortable. I'm sitting here thinking is my color going to come out ok? and is this girl going to be speaking about me to other people when i leave her chair? at the end of it all, the color ended up irritating my scalp and she seemed to have missed a few grey areas.

I had Amber who was a blast to talk to and did an incredible job on my hair. She was very precise and attentive and did it exactly how I had pictured it.

50,"My son went to great clips in Springfield, PA, as he usually does, but this time he was very dissatisfied due to the butchering he received from the stylist. We told him that if he was going to be butchered like that he was better off going to Roy Tweedy's ( which is a real butcher shop). I'm not sure if it was because he was a teenager, or for the fact that he use the coupon that was mailed to us, but either way they did a horrible job, and it costs more to fix his hair the way it should have been done in the first place. My husband called the salon upon my sons return, to see if we could resolve the situation, but of course we never received a response. No call back from any manager, or any apologies whatsoever. I would highly advise that no one go to great clips in Springfield until they get their act together! As for us, we are a large family and we go there a lot, but will never step foot in that place again!",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

51,"A really nice place to get your hair did with as much of an edge as you want. 

In the East Loop, across from the Pageant, might be one of the most underrated salons in the city. I first went into this place as a walk-in, and keep on going back. Yes, I'm a guy, and since my hair is pretty coarse, grows weird, and I want a bit of style to it, I go to hair salons. At V Vegaz I've never been dissatisfied with my cut. 

When you walk in you realize how spacious the place is, with a bit of a slightly modern, slightly baroque interior design. There's a nice vibe there too amongst the employees, and you can see that the stylists are happy with the work situation. Of course, happy stylists, to me, mean better haircuts.

I go to Callie, since that first walk-in, and keep on going back. Yes, she's real friendly, which is a nice touch, but she's also a great stylist. I'm a bit wishy washy when I look for a cut, usually changing what I want most of the time. Callie's sensitive to that, and really understands how my hair grows and where it's going to move. I think the biggest compliment to her is that, as I'm a once a month haircut kinda guy, my brother and sister told me they really my hair a full month after I had it cut with Callie. So that's really a testament to her skills.

I've not gotten color there, but it is a full service salon, and not just a turn and burn place. 

I highly recommend this place.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

53,"For a $16 haircut, I was expecting an OK-looking trim (all I really needed was some damage control - just someone to lop off my split ends and maybe add a few layers). What I got was a very professionally looking haircut that works well with my face shape and made my hair a lot healthier and happier. My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience. Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough. I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!! The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time. I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had. I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job. I think it's important that the school has a series of steps and checklists their students have to go through to ensure they are giving you the best experience possible.

54,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Belle Starr. I've been seeing the owner, Cass, for my color for the past two years and she is so talented. She has taken me from platinum blonde, to creamsicle copper, to champagne blonde, to my current balayage golden blonde. With all that color you'd think my hair would be brittle and damaged but it's not because Cass is super knowledgeable, uses the best products, and offers effective deep conditioning treatments. 

In addition, her salon doubles as a community art space. There is always great local art for sale on the walls, the occasional yoga class where proceeds go to local community organizations, and beauty nights where you get to learn about and test products for free. I even won a jar of organic, vegan body scrub in a raffle at the last beauty night (super exciting for someone who never wins anything!).

55,"Lé Chandelier Salon & Boutique (formerly known as Blush Salon Roxborough--which I also reviewed) is a top notch salon with affordable prices. I've been a customer since day one and recommend the salon to everyone. The atmosphere is a Breakfast at Tiffany's feel! Touches of sparkle, diamonds, and pearls. As you approach the salon you will first notice the Chandeliers in the window. As you walk in you are greeted by the friendly staff and a welcoming waiting area. The staff is personable, down to earth, and makes you feel comfortable right away. They listen to what you want and offer suggestions when needed. I never feel rushed and always leave happy. If you have questions on anything my stylist (Angel) has always answered and explained the process. It's always a great feeling when strangers ask, ""Where do you get your hair done?!?"" Or ""I want your curls!"" The salon is clean and when I'm there, there is always someone sweeping and keeping the salon tidy. The staff also holds tutorials on hair as well as makeup!

56,"I moved to the Wilmington area in 2006 for grad school, and it took many months (and several bad haircuts) to find a great salon that will give a stylish men's haircut. I found Fabrizio's and have never gone anywhere else since! I have seen Linda there for almost 7 years because she is THAT good. She is so sweet and caring, and she really knows her stuff. I have gone in not knowing what I want, but knowing I want something different. Linda asks me a few questions, then I walk out with a quality and stylish haircut. And if for some reason I am not happy (which has never happened), Linda always tells me I can come back free of charge and she will fix whatever I'm not happy with.

The front desk staff is also great - the type of place where they know you and greet you by name when you come in the door. Rita is so friendly and helpful! I love this place and Linda so much that even when I moved to PA, I still make the trip to Fabrizio's for my monthly haircut. I promise you, you won't find a better salon in the area.

Two tips: I don't believe they let you charge tips to credit cards, so make sure you bring cash with you. There is an ATM in the salon, but it will charge you a fee. And regarding parking, there is a very small lot (4 spaces or so) behind the salon, so most likely you will need to park on the street.

57,"Thanks Carleen for the wonderful appointment! My mini vacay to Reno is not complete without a visit to Carleen. I don't cut my hair often and usually wait til I have Rapunzel length hair when I see her.

Her studio is super easy to get to (very close to GSR). She always asks in advance your hair inspiration and will talk you through it before she works her magic. She makes you feel at home..drinks, snacks, free wifi, coloring books (for adults), beauty bar and much more.

Another thing I awesomely appreciate is that..I am not a very social talker and she and her staff make it super comfortable for me here.","free wifi, coloring books",,,,"free wifi, coloring books","The salon has free wifi.

I've been looking for a salon I'd like to come back to for a few years and I finally found it! I'm so sad it took me so long. This is the perfect place for a whole new 'do or just a bang trim. I have felt very comfortable sitting in the chair and letting Kristine, Salina, or Gloriana update my look.
As for the art on the walls, I love how they are always changing. This is one of the best little art galleries and I've discovered so many cool local artists by also looking at the walls while I was shopping. I met Beth, the gallery director, and she really knows her stuff. 
And as for the fashion part of the store, it is also art! Leigh Anne is such a talented designer. She has beautiful dresses with sleek lines that fit an array of bodies. Her original designs are what cocktail party dreams are made of.
AND my favorite part about The Disco Dolls Studio is that it's sustainable! These women have made a commitment to helping our planet and each other and it shows in their ethics and in the way they conduct business. And it's soooo nice to shop at a place where I know the products are ethically sourced and I can feel good about buying them.

62,"I found this place through yelp after I heard that my last stylist left. It was tricky to find the storefront because I didn't know it was inside the gym. Walking and getting a little workout walking up the ramp towards the gym, I entered a cute little salon tucked in the back of the gym. I was greeted by a wonderful friendly staff. My stylist was Matt. I was skeptical on getting a haircut by a guy because I never had a guy done my hair, but he was wonderful! He knew exactly what I wanted and paid even special attention to my hair. He even gave me tips because I have really fine Asian hair. All I can say is great staff, and great cut. A little pricier than the other places i been to, but for quality cuts it's worth it.",,,,gym,,,,,The salon is inside a gym.,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

63,"Love, love, love George at Salon Belladonna. I have been seeing George for almost 8 years. He is incredible. He nails my beautiful blond color each time and cuts and styles perfectly. I am frequently asked where I get my hair done and recommend folks to George. I was just there on Friday and George colored and cut layers into my hair. It came out out great and I love it! My daughter loved my hair so much she asked me to set up and appt with George for a new look. Her hair came out awesome. She went from one length long hair to the cutest angled bob. Fits her face perfectly! 
I always look forward to my hair appt and having some time to see George. His room is private and he always has great music playing. Very comfortable vibe with lots of great conversation and laughs.
George is always so wonderful to accommodate my work schedule and meets me early in the morning.

66,"I initially heard about The Beauty Parlour from friends. Every time they went to this salon they'd come back with gorgeous haircuts & colours. After one particularly bad haircut, I decided to try out the Parlour.
According to their website, The BP believes in beauty with a conscience. They offer ammonia-free colour services with little or no scent properties or chemical emanation. They also stock Kevin Murphy products, of which I am a fan. 
Anyways, after walking up the stairs to their 2nd floor location (note:no elevators) I immediately feel comfortable in their spacious, tranquil salon. I feel relaxed here, and I enjoy the vintage-y ambiance created by their reclaimed furnishings and wood flooring. It's also got high windows with views of Whyte Ave.
The friendly receptionist usually offers wine (!), coffee, green tea, or juice. While waiting for my stylist Alysha, I check out their mini-boutique. Clothing from local designer Cinder+Smoke and jewelry from local artist Plum Tipsy are among the fun products they stock.
I always get my hair done by Alysha. She listens as I attempt to describe what i want, and my hair turns out gorgeous every time. She cuts with precision and doesn't use the razor much to texture my coarse,thick hair.
I highly recommend Alysha!
Because I have short hair, I am charged for a men's cut ($60), so it's very reasonable, in my opinion, for an exceptional salon. Also, you get 5% off if you pay with cash!

69,"Let me preface by saying that I have been getting my hair cut by a guy in Austin for seven years, even though I've lived in other cities for half that time. He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.

My friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said ""look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days."" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.

Allison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.

One of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut. All good things when you're trying your best to be a frugal grad student.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

First off, every client receives a 5 minute scalp massage and treatment every time they come in for a service. This service is to die for and something that keeps me coming back time and time again. On some occasions I have even received a hand massage while I wait for my colour to set. Wow.

Second, this salon actively and passionately cares about our environment. Sylvia's product line, Aveda, is derived from 100% natural ingredients. Not only that but they are one of the only salons I know of who recycles & repurposes hair, foils, colour-tubes, papers and plastics AND diverts excess hair chemicals from being rinsed down the drain through a program called green circles.

Third, the staff members are always so pleasant and speak so highly of one another. The support among the women is real and it is so refreshing to hear and feel it. Not only that but each one of them has a portfolio available on Pinterest and Instagram where you can go browse each stylists look book. This gives you a great glimpse into which stylist would most suit your style. I for one love this.

Fourth, the owner of the salon actively invests in her employees education. Each stylist receives continuous support and training from day one so that they are always working on and building upon their craft.

Fifth, the atmosphere is warm, welcoming and smells divine. The music is soft and enjoyable, the tea is soothing and I always feel so beautiful when I walk out that door.

79,"I needed a reward for choosing (stupidly) to grow my hair out during a Tucson summer. My answer? A hair cut that costs more than $12 (with tip).

I arrived about 20 minutes before my appointment and was quickly attended to (by the owner) without even having to sit down. I sat in the stylist's chair, and we discussed the cut and style I was hoping for.
She then sent me down to have my hair washed, which was a perfectly pleasant experience. Certainly a more thorough one than I usually undertake. Once complete, I headed back to the stylist.

She confirmed our plan and assured me that she had a great plan. During the cut, she was nice (not too talkative), funny, inquisitive, and calm. She answered all the questions I had about how best to care for the cut and offered suggestions on how to ensure that I got the most out of  it. I could not be happier with how the cut and style turned out - no matter how the rest of me looks, I know my hair is kickin'.

Separate them using commas. context: I needed a reward for choosing (stupidly) to grow my hair out during a Tucson summer. My answer? A hair cut that costs more than $12 (with tip).

I arrived about 20 minutes before my appointment and was quickly attended to (by the owner) without even having to sit down. I sat in the stylist's chair, and we discussed the cut and style I was hoping for.
She then sent me down to have my hair washed, which was a perfectly pleasant experience. Certainly a more thorough one than I usually undertake. Once complete, I headed back to the stylist.

She confirmed our plan and assured me that she had a great plan. During the cut, she was nice (not too talkative), funny, inquisitive, and calm. She answered all the questions I had about how best to care for the cut and offered suggestions on how to ensure that I got the most out of  it. I could not be happier with how the cut and style turned out - no matter how the rest of me looks, I know my hair is kickin'.

In the end, the price was well more than advertised, but not so much that I would balk at it for the value.

80,"Ok, so I gave Icon another try. I was walking through Commerce Place when I passed a mirror and remembered I was desperately in need of a haircut. I decided to give them a try again - and I'm glad I did. A woman named Jayme cut my hair and I honestly haven't had such a hip, modern cut in long time. This time the service was exceptional, and I have to say that the salon has improved by leaps and bounds. I learned it's under new management. The studio has adopted a more boutique-style environment, with artwork on the walls and they even have a tattoo studio attached. The place was quiet, as it was in the middle of the afternoon during the week, but I wouldn't be surprised if weekends are packed. I was really impressed with Jayme's friendly service and she even gave me tips for styling my hair, without pushing product on me - a pet peeve of mine at salons. I will definitely go back for a haircut, and may even try a colour there next time. Keep up the good work, Icon.",tattoo studio,"boutique-style environment, artwork",,,"boutique-style environment, artwork, tattoo studio",The salon has a tattoo studio attached.,"The salon has adopted a more boutique-style environment, with artwork on the walls.",,,"The studio has adopted a more boutique-style environment, with artwork on the walls and they even have a tattoo studio attached.","Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

81,"I don't know what to say about Joseph Anthony. I feel genuinely torn. On one hand I felt as if the staff went to great lengths to make you feel like you were in a spa: they have free water, wine, coffee, and warm cookies; they spend a lot of time massaging your scalp while you get your hair cut, they offer free hand massages, and their towels are warm. On paper, it sounds great.

My problem is that I felt like I was in a factory that was trying to churn out the most cuts and colors possible. They were booked solid and you could tell that the staff was stressed out because everyone was basically running around trying to get things accomplished. No matter how relaxing they try to make it for the customers, it's just too many people in a small space all trying to get a task completed quickly. Their prices also aren't very competitive (I paid $40.00 for a simple hair trim where I would pay $25-$30 for the same service in the city).

I know they offer a lot of other services, so those experiences may be very different from what you get in the hair salon. I doubt I'll go back to find out for myself. I just feel as though the higher prices could only be justified if the ambiance and overall experience were something pleasurable, and I simply didn't think that the feel of the place was that great.

Beware that tips must be paid in cash - you can't tip on a credit card (that's also another strike against this joint).","free hand massages, other services",,,,"free hand massages, other services",The salon offers free hand massages.

82,"I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

85,"I've never written a review in yelp but I was so disappointed with the results of my haircut today. I came in for a last minute impulsive haircut and was excited to find a place with such good reviews that had appointments so soon. I'm in college, and so $50 (plus tip and uber money) was a bit of a splurge for me to be disappointed. My experience at the salon was good, everyone was friendly and my hairdresser seemed to know what she was doing. She had cut and blow dried my hair and trimmed down the front when I had asked. I left the salon really happy with my new hair. After coming home and styling it as I typically do (lightly straightening it), I found that my hair had been cut messy and uneven. I could have done a better job myself. I wish I would have seen this before leaving the salon, but the lady who had cut my hair had hidden the messy job by blow drying the ends under.

UPDATE: I called today to see if I could come back in and have someone with more experience fix my hair and they told me I could come back in but it would be an extra charge to have somebody else fix it. I understand that each individual stylist has their own price and needs to be paid, but I think that the salon should have enough confidence in the abilities of the people that they hire to be willing to cover the costs of their own employees mistakes. I would have been better off going to supercuts.",,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following hair salon review, list aspects that are atypical for a hair salon.

86,"The answer is yes.

I went to Fringe because I had been hearing great things about them and I was ready for a change. Not that I didn't love looking like a rainbow straight outta 1986; that was lots of fun. But having pink/purple/blue hair gets a little tiring after a while, and so I just wanted to simplify things a bit. I wanted to look a little softer. So I let Roberta do her thing and soon enough I was sporting a new 'do in a more natural hue (yes, I am also a poet).

The salon itself is full of good energy. Erin, the owner, is one of the nicest people I've had the pleasure of meeting, and Olivia and Roberta are super cool. I can't leave out Uli, the shop cat, who will sit on your lap while you're getting your hair done and take a nap. I loved that part.

They also host openings in the space and are active in the local music/dance/art scene as well. Look for the neon walls and disco scissor sign hanging outside of their shop on P'yunk. Then, scoot your ass inside and make an appointment!","Uli, shop cat, openings, local music/dance/art scene","neon walls, disco scissor sign",,,"Uli, shop cat, openings, local music/dance/art scene, neon walls, disco scissor sign","The salon has Uli, the shop cat, who sits on your lap.
