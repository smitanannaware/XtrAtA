3,The breakfast here is on point the tortas carne asada  are very good! The place itself looks like a hole in the wall but the food is authentic and the portions are nice size. There are a few of these locations around town which makes it easy to grab a burrito or torta during lunch because they have so many locations. The only issue I have is that the establishments are small and sometimes the staff has a hard time getting the food out quick during a rush. Overall it's a legit spot for authentic Mexican food .,,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

4,"A bit high priced, and the food is overall good, but not amazing. Still, I really enjoyed myself here probably because I just love sitting at a place on the water (even if the road is right nearby). The place seems large and mostly outdoors. It's a casual fun atmosphere and boaters can come right up to dock. You can also bring your pets! In fact, I saw one guy who brought his parakeet on his shoulder! lolWe had some tasty frozen drinks, that either hid the alcohol taste very well with all the sweetness or it was lacking enough alcohol. I'm not sure which, but kinda leaning towards the latter. They have a few beers on tap, but may not be familiar with them. For example, our waitress didn't know that there are several types of Sam Adams beers when I asked which one was on tap.I had the stuffed flounder for my main course and ate every bite. However, I could have been better with less sauce on it. My stomach hurt from all that afterwards I think. We tried the fried cheesecake for dessert...it was okay. Nothing exciting.If you're looking for a leisurely dinner outside while enjoying the Florida atmosphere, this is your place.

5,"This is a review of a family Thanksgiving dinner - conceived and cooked at Charro Steak. Then heated and enjoyed at home surrounded by our small family on this out of sorts Thanksgiving. The meal was wonderful. 5 stars. More if they had the option. Everything was wonderfully prepared and thoughtfully packaged with detailed, fool-proof instructions. The bird was moist, tasty, and gorgeous. The elotes and stuffing, in a coop with Barrio Bread, were delicious. The buttery smooth green Chile mashed potatoes were a hit!  And the gravy - oh the gravy was heaven.   Si Charro always impresses. And this was no exception.  You could tell the food was prepared with love. All their restaurants have taken great care and invested a lot of money to stay rolling. Whether you're looking for some great takeout or you're comfortable eating in a restaurant, this restaurant group deserves your business. They have certainly earned it!",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant. Separate them using commas.,,"question: Given the following restaurant review, list what is atypical in the restaurant.

6,"It's my second time coming to this place. I love the concept of it. They have healthy good food, great craft selection, tea, coffee, non dairy options. What cool about this place is how kid friendly it is. They have a section where you can take your kids. They have a professional babysitting service at the restaurant. Wanna drink a beer without your 3 year old, it possible at this restaurant. The restrooms are kid friendly also. Forgot your diaper, they got you. They have a good selection of different size diapers. Wanna work or finish a paper and have someone watch your kid. The food is pretty good but the portions are little small. I have had the Cuban and it comes with chips. I have also had one of their bowls and that was really good. I was able to customize both of those meals to be dairy free.

7,"Worst dining experience I've ever had. I went in with low expectations...burger bar on Bourbon St...at 9pm. We were seated at an awkward bar, table, island thing, even though there were open ""regular"" tables. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and get our drink order, and then another 15 to actually get them. While we were waiting, we saw a RAT, yes, a rat, scamper across the floor into the bar area. Food arrived about 30 minutes after it was ordered, and it was average at best. Once checks were brought, our waiter became a ghost. We had to take credit cards to a manager to get them processed. If you're on Bourbon, do yourself a favor...skip the Bayou Burger.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

I have no idea what we ordered, but I'll try my best: Braised beef noodle soup: so good, and really helped my hangover :) the noodles were cooked al dente and had a good beef flavor. Popcorn chicken: really good! Juicy, large pieces of chicken. Not overloaded with batter. Crispy pork roll: also very good. My friend said this was her favorite. Stinky tofu: ok, I didn't like this. I like the idea of something savory with pickled veggies, but I just don't like the smell. Tomato with scrambled egg: this tasted too watery and didn't have enough flavor for me.

9,"Royaly Rude off ellerslie was our 'go to' pizza place until the last experience with their managers deterred us for a long time. We ordered two medium pizzas and coke, came to 45.00 plus tip. The pizzas were both terribly made. Hardly any cheese with holes to the extra thick Dow that had no flavour. The toppings were ok but the sauce nearly invisible. Normally when something like this happens I bring it to a manager so they can offer a solution. The first manager I spoke to the following day offered us a 10.00 credit which I declined as our order was 50.00 after extra charges. She then told me she was placing a credit for both pizzas onto our account, which I clairifies before ending the call. That was two weeks ago. When I called last night they told me I had 10.00 credit and that they would call me back after speaking  with the manager who had applied this. They did not call me back. I caller again this morning to follow up and was told the girl didn't end up coming to work last night due to car troubles. She then had another fairly rude manager call me to tell me I'm basically lying about the whole thing. Not sure who is actually in charge over at that location but they could use a customer service course! Won't return for a long time! Very disappointed! If your going To charge royal prices, perhaps should hire some staff too match.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

12,"There is a sign right out front that is not very customer service friendly, kind of a turn off from the very beginning. The wait was 30 min, they were on time with that.

We ordered two fish spread, only received one. When we asked if we ordered one or two? The waitress snapped at us very rudely and said you ordered a salad and I was going to bring it out as your meal. Response was okay, tone was horrible! Some of us received refills, most did not. I am okay with the smoking at the bar, but there were people smoking way away from the bar and the entire place smelled of stale smoke. The food was edible  which is why they are getting one star. They had a shorter wait which is why we chose to eat there, my advice is to take the longer wait somewhere else and have better service and food.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

The Shrimp sweet basil is very good and so is the triple-flavor red snapper.  I also have to hand it to this place for making my favorite thai iced tea in Philly.

It wasn't busy at all when I came in on a Monday afternoon but when I got my pho, it was so good. One thing I always pay attention to when eating pho at restaurants are the noodles.

The wall of polaroids of customers does a nice job balancing out all the geometric shapes and synthetic materials, and keeps the Fat Straw from feeling sterile.

Along with the usual flavors, some more interesting possibilities that caught my eye were red bean, honeydew, lychee, pomegranate, ginger, elvis (banana + peanut butter), and sesame.

21,"Absolutely wonderful! I was headed up to Santa Barbara and knew I'd be in town early enough to grab some breakie - there are a few Jeannine's locations but I of course wanted to stop in Montecito. What a charming little bakery with amazing food. I arrived around 830A on a Saturday and there were only a few people in line in front of me. Order and pay at the cash register, then seat yourself - coffee was out very quickly and food followed soon after.

22,"Roast, Inc. was my favorite Nashville coffee shop by far. I was super bummed when they closed. And I'm now even more excited that Brad and Lesa have opened a new shop, with a different vibe, in a much more convenient location. First, the coffee. They roast all of their coffees in house and they have established, close relationships with all their suppliers. They choose only quality coffees and are roasting constantly to support both their wholesale business (local restaurants, coffee shops, Whole Foods, etc.) and their newly rejuvenated retail business. Second, the customer service. The folks at Roast LOVE coffee - this is no secret. It seems that they are equally bought into a love of coffee education. They really do nurture the average coffee consumer, should he or she so choose, into taking a step or two below the surface of coffee brewing, roasting and enjoyment. For example - at this new Roast location, if you order a cup of pour over coffee, you are greeted on the other side of the counter by a barista (or perhaps Lesa or Brad, if they're not busy in the back roasting and tending to business) who asks: ""Would you like me to brew your cup for you or would you like to do it yourself?"" Mostly out of curiosity, I asked Lesa to brew my cup for me. She proceeded to walk me through the entire process - she walked me through choosing one of the two roasts they had waiting in separate burr grinders, explained common missteps during the grinding process, showed me how to let the coffee bloom and why that is important, and finally, demonstrated how to complete the process gradually (over 3-4 minutes) to finish the perfect 16oz cup. Lesa wanted me to learn how to make a perfect pour over cup from scratch by myself, and perhaps next time, I will. I'm not a big ""coffee drink"" guy, but many of my friends are, and I can say that anything with an espresso base that I've tried (latte, cappucino) has been fantastic. The store itself is spacious - there are many places to sit, work and enjoy your coffee. While I was sitting enjoying my pour over, one of the baristas brought around samples of a coffee he had just brewed in a Siphon pot. Yes please. I'll also give a huge thumbs up for location - I was among the crew that was willing to trek to Trousdale for a cup of MTO coffee, but I don't think anyone can argue that this new location isn't much better for the average Nashville consumer. And hopefully, a long-lived retail business will support this theory.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

23,"This place is more of an indoor cat petting zoo than a cat cafe. When I think of a cat cafe, I think of more chairs & tables with food & drinks being served & cats lounging around & walking about. But the focus here is the cats, which is fine. My husband & I were fine with paying for the entrance fee to support the cats. Fortunately, I found this place through Yelp, so we got 20% off the entrance fee, which came out to $8 per person. The entrance fee includes coffee, tea or wine, which is placed at a self-serve station in the front door area. There were a few some stools & tables in the room. Guests can place their belongings away from the cats in the side cubicles. There were over 10 cats here to interact with. Many of them were sleeping on the big pillows on the floor when we arrived. One orange cat was particularly hissy & scratched my husband when we visited. It wasn't too bad of a scratch though. The lady who greeted us at the door was polite & cordial.

26,"Bastion of all things foodey, Di Bruno brothers has become our once every few month treat shopping spot. Stocked form floor to ceiling with the finest in gourmet treats, I'm usually stocking up on hard to find spices, some unique cheeses, and prosciutto when I stop by, but the occasional sweet does make it into my cart. Yes, I tried the $130/lb prosciutto, and no, it's not worth it. It was very, very good, but I simply couldn't find $130/lb goodness in it. the $35/lb house stuff was fine with me. The Vahlrona Bacon Chocolate bar has become a household favorite, occasionally managing to survive the trip home. Half sour pickles, saratoga sparkling water, and now Sarcone's bakery bread also make their way into our basket.The cheese shop is a great experience, with helpful, knowledgeable staff who always manage to find us the cheese we're in the mood for that day. If I didn't have the perfect butcher already, I'd be buying my specialty cuts here. Pate, for those who indulge, is lovely and they usually have a nice, fresh selection including plain old plain. How pleasant to get back to a basic like this without juniper berries, duck tears, or unicorn smiles with cardamom or some such silliness. Their homemade calves liverwurst also will rock your world, smooth, mild, and rich.If it wasn't for the ignorant uncontrolled children that populate the place on weekends I'd give this place a five star shopping experience. I know, it' s not their fault about the kids, but it's an aspect you need to take into account. Last Sunday while shopping this family with three kids decided to play 'tag' around my family and I. After about forty five seconds of this horse-sh*t during which one kid made a play grab for my wallet (I had it in my hand to pay promptly) I turned around and advised the younger, yuppie Dad if he didn't get his kids away from me I'd tag him right there and then let my son kick his son's a$$ for fun. For the record, that's fifteen seconds and a warning longer than I ever would have waited before, so I guess I am mellowing now that I've hit 40. And yes, stay off my damn lawn. Rotten kids. ;)But returning to our review, there are some other reasons why no five stars; no toothpicks near the cheese samples allows all those fingers to touch it before you do. Especially fingers that have also touched everything else including one's nose. Open doors let flies in, finding plenty to perch on at the new Sarcone's bread display. The olive bread was apparently particularly inviting on Sunday, as I decided against any of the bread and rolls based on the number of 'friends' resting on them.Service is usually very good and with a smile, especially at the prepared food and cheese counters.

The gift shop is a gem. Great place to shop and browse after brunch. I have only been on a weekday for breakfast, know that the crowd does pick up for lunch. Would recommend!"
34,"I've lived in this neighborhood for over ten years. This used to be one of my favorite spots. The service has gotten increasingly worse over the last few years but tonight they lost my business forever. I went in with my young son at 4:30. There were only 4 tables occupied. The two waitresses were rolling silverware and talking to the host. We were sat and given lunch menus, which it was not. But then pointedly ignored. The host went back to gossiping with the waitresses and they didn't come to the table or even look our way for 10 minutes. They couldn't have made it more obvious that they did not want us there. We sat quietly but I  really wanted to see what they'd do. My son was confused and thirsty and finally, disappointed, asked if we could go to the car. We left and no one said a word. They just gave us a look like they were glad were leaving. Message received loud and clear.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

38,"The night I was there they had three acts, all terrible & raunchy! They were pop/electric/rap one-man singers. It was like a karaoke bar, with all recorded music and cheezy props. The headline act did have a piano & keyboards, but about half his songs were off of recorded music. It was a small crowd of mostly 20's age women, screaming and going gaga over the three sexy guy performers (if you want to call them that). They sang sex songs, using the f-word every other sentence. The headliner even admitted that people think of him as a singer of only sex songs. But he did want us to know that he had a few others in his repertoire. I wouldn't go back unless it was to see a band I know and like.The bright spot of the night was having dinner at the restaurant. We had great food and great service.

The staff has always been nice and accommodating and the courtyard is the best for a romantic South Philly date night. Let's start with drinks - I always get a bottle of Montepulciano or Lambrusco. Both are great. I've ordered cocktails here a few times (typically a Negroni or Old Fashion) and have never been overly impressed, I'd say stick with wine. The Affettati Misti is hands down my favorite appetizer - it's enough for a group of 3 or 4 to share, or the burrata is always a good bet as well. The pasta here is so good I've honestly never bothered to order anything else for an entree. They rotate the menu pretty often but some of my favorites from seasons past are the Summer Pasta (it was sweet corn and zucchini), Hazelnut Gnocchi, and Taccozzelle with Pork Sausage Ragu.

They offer alternative milk options, have gluten free choices for sandwich lunches, potato chips on the side, and even a couple of gluten free muffins and goodies. They were sold out of the chocolate confection I wanted to try, so we had the gluten free, chocolate muffin...which they graciously warmed for us, as well as provided a knife to cut it for sharing. We both had a delicious latte, as well as pressed gluten free, lunch meat sandwiches (around seven bucks each). The sandwiches come with lettuce and tomato. My other half requested no tomato. They goofed, but since he had the gluten free bread, I gladly took his tomato. This shop invests the profits into the local community. They have a spot for refugees to make and sell jewelry, car dangles, cards, and more. Awakenings doesn't charge for the space and doesn't take a dime. It is cash only, as they need to keep the money for the refugees separate from their coffee shop. The world needs more of this compassionate attitude and the world can always use more great coffee. They even roast their own beans! They have plenty of seating and did a great job of visually creating three separate seating areas. Larger groups can gather to drink bean juice of the gods and know their money is helping those who need it. :) There is a small dais, immediately to the left upon entrance. In the back, far right corner...low slung chairs and small sofas converge. The remaining space is filled with tables, coupled with two to six chairs. This shop can be easy to miss, if you are not familiar with what is in the area, as they sit back from the road, in a strip mall (Idaho loves these). They do have plenty of parking.

They are located on the north-west corner of Overland and Five-Mile. They also showcase local artists. They have large paintings, for sale...as well as other painters on display to get the word out. You can come have your coffee and get your gift shopping accomplished in one stop."

52,"What Your Body's Been Craving For...""I waltzed into this coffee/espresso bar looking for a way to zap up my tired head while at the same time delaying my arrival to work. I've seen Crave and thought.. yeah... another one of those coffee shacks who won't last longer than a week. Then a week passed by. Then months, and I think its almost been a year. I figured 'a year, what the heck, try them'.I hear this ""hello, welcome, how are you doing today"" coming from out of nowhere. When I got closer to the counter I was jostled into conversation with a spunky 14-year old looking adult with beautiful thick hair and well groomed brows. He basically looked like a Caucasian version of Prince, even with the attitude. So after asking me a few questions he was quickly preparing my Caramel Macchiato of which I somehow ordered. What took me by surprise is how cocky my server was, especially when he stated that his stuff was better than Starbucks. Now, everyone knows Starbucks is dammnnn good. I never ever trust a person who toots their own horn. So I gave a demand despite of his self assuredness... ""don't make my Macchiatto sweet"". Despite my request, he continued to talk this game, made some design in my drink, and then passed it onto me. So I'm thinking ""Whateva, just because you made a cutesy little design in my drink doesn't make up for how bad its gonna taste"" I wanted to take my drink and run because I didn't want to have to ruin his day as soon as he asks for a critique of it. I basically only needed the caffeine....Sip... ?!?!? Sip, sip.... wha da! I had to turn away from the door and walk up to this Prince ingenue and tell him this was the bomb. I've never felt this way about a cup of joe before. Okay, what I couldn't put into words while taking my first sip is that: 1) Their coffee doesn't taste like burnt trash. It is strong, but not with that bitter taste. It tastes robust without you being paranoid thinking that the cleanup crew secretly scrapes off the bottoms of ashtrays and brews the scrapings for tomorrow's java. 2) The price isn't bad 3) Its just good stuff without giving you a migraine. Apparently Crave is a hip place to be. One day out of the week they have some sort of open mic where local artists can perform. I haven't witnessed this at myself, but hey, I'm sure its cool. Crave, just like Starbucks, has an assortment of pastries and other fine things one associates with when drinking coffee.

54,"The ambiance is great, they have a children's menu, they serve half rolls upon request, and the staff are friendly.  The sushi is really lacking though...There were huge inconsistencies between our first and second visits, so it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason, but I think a big part of it might be the rice.  It has a chewy texture that I really wasn't a fan of. Add baking to that rice, as some of the rolls did, and it's a gummy, chewy mess. The nigiri during our first visit had a nice rice to fish ratio, our second visit...the nigiri was huge, not the bite sized pieces it should be.  I did like the egg roll appetizer, although I think that it was more like a rolled crab Rangoon than an egg roll.  The dragon balls were tasty on our first visit (breaded and fried jalapeño coins topped with crab and a tasty sauce), but on our second visit...the jalapeños were not really cooked, the breading fell off...and the ribs and seeds hadn't been removed so the jalapeños were just raw and too spicy/hot for me to eat. Ok, now on to the children's menu.  I think it is great that they offer one, but the chicken jerky that they tried pass off as chicken strips was just atrocious.  It was so thinly sliced that when breaded and fried it became almost inedible.  My grandson gnawed on one piece for a few minutes before giving up on it altogether.

I mean these dance buffs are so concerned with getting the next dance ready they forget their guests. Issue number 2 is the portions always change. I got the same crab pot and the second time was much less. I complained to the manager ( thank god he doesn't dance) and he gave me an extra crab leg but they are charging more and giving less. Its a shame because seafood is lacking out here and we have to deal with these dancing bafoons and above average food..

57,"I have been to Pinewood Social three times now: twice for dinner and drinks, and once for a lunchtime business meeting. Each time, I leave Pinewood in a better mood than when I entered. Why? Because spaces like Pinewood make you happy to be alive, to be so incredibly lucky to be surrounded by beauty and dining on the finest food and libations available, to live in a town that continues to grow and nurture entrepreneurs like the Goldberg brothers, who own this and other equally enjoyable establishments in town. The first visit was the first week it opened, and three friends and I decided to order a variety of dishes to share and sample. Our favorites were the cauliflower salad, the ""things on toast"" (we had one of each), and for entrees, the fried chicken, cheeseburger, and Reuben sandwich. Honestly, everything was great, and we also enjoyed two rounds each of cocktails, as well as after dinner coffee cocktails. The Curtado with Fernet was amazing and I am craving one just thinking of it. My second visit was for lunch, and I ordered the kale caeser with shrimp. It was delicious and a nice portion for lunch. My coworker had the cheeseburger. We enjoyed coffee and remained seated for over two hours, discussing work. The flow from lunch-meeting to meeting-over-coffee was seamless and both of us commented how nice the space was for working. We never felt rushed and were attentively served. The third time was again for dinner and drinks. We order oysters (delicious) and burgers (I was craving the burger since watching my coworker devour his). My friend got cauliflower as her side, and commented to her server that it was overly salted. Our server promptly took it and returned with a new, less seasoned serving. As a veteran of the restaurant industry, this is the type of service that makes me know Pinewood deserves five stars- things go wrong. Nothing is always perfect. Patrons should let their server know if something isn't right. How the server responds shows what level of service is expected at the business. Our server responded exactly how I hoped- she made things right. We couldn't have been happier with our night. I plan to go back for breakfast this week. I have not bowled yet, but the bowling alley looks awesome and is decked out with vintage equipment. In all, Pinewood Social is a step above any other venture in Nashville. Everything is done with the highest taste level without feeling stuffy or pretentious. I would take my grandmother there, a date there, or again, a coworker for a meeting.

58,"Our recent date night at The Farm and Fisherman was pretty flawless. From the food to the service to the restaurant itself, it was a great evening. Judy was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu inside and out and had a real appreciation for food. Obviously, I like that in a server! We started out with delicious parker rolls - it was all I could do to not wolf the entire thing but I was trying to save my cals for the rest of the meal. Josh Lawler does some really incredible things with seasonal ingredients. This was showcased especially in the first course: grilled eggplant with burrata, and a slow roasted squash. Both plates were filled with vibrant colors from the ingredients and accompanying sauces. The flavors were wonderful, and every bite was different. Next I had scallops, which were served with pastrami and sweet corn. On point. Now that it's a couple weeks later, I don't remember what my dining partner had for his second course, but I do know he enjoyed whatever it was (helpful, I know). My main course was a grilled tri tip steak, which was very lean and very tender. It was served with lima beans, which I really liked as an alternate to the usual potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his bacon-wrapped quail. Who wouldn't love a teeny bird wrapped in bacon? For dessert we shared a lemon tart which was perfection. I'm literally shaking my head at the memory. Get the tart. This was our second visit to this restaurant. The first was nearly a year ago, after they first opened. I have to admit, I enjoyed this second visit so much more, and I think it had a lot to do with the seasonal fruits and veggies of late summer.

That flavor is probably the worst flavor I've ever tasted. Altogether, that milkshake was absolutely the most disgusting milkshake I've ever had. I took a few sips to make sure that I hadn't misunderstood it for some reason. The milkshake texture was perfect, but the aftertaste of habanero was intolerable - partially because I wasn't expecting habanero, and partially because I didn't like it. I felt nauseous for an hour after taking 3 sips. I thought about returning and asking for my money back, but I made the bad choice. I'll just never make that mistake again.

Sometimes even with a little chickpea/veggie mix on top. Why compromise? For the Veg heads you can do falafel which I hear is good.

67,"20 dollar unlimited beverage brunch! Why hello there, Gypsy Saloon. Way to know exactly how to sweet talk me. Unfortunately, your words only lasted so long. Bffski and I had a very rare leisurely sunday brunch here around noon thirty. Our waitress was super dull and super basic. Not that she was UNfriendly or UNhelpful, just a bit uncaring. Meh. Their pre fix menu is not overly large, but I'm sure everyone could find something they liked. We each picked some savory southwestern eggy type deals and were off to the races. We were started off with a bread plate that was not bad at all. Unless you are on a diet, like we were pretending not to be on that day. Our main courses were pretty decent, and I liked the potatoes. Unfortunately, we were each missing nearly all of our flavorful condiments necessary for our plates to be enjoyed. I appreciated it did not take long to get our server's attention and seconds for the problem to be corrected with no hassle. Obviously it would have been better had they been on our plates already, but whatevs, we were already into our third mimosa course. All in all, the brunch was not bad, and it was a great atmosphere for the situation. We really liked the decor and the set up. This time would have been probably been 3 stars by itself. However, a few weeks later, bffski and I tried to go in for happy hour. Tried. We waited about twenty minutes at the very small bar and received no service. Wasted so much precious happy hour time and we just got up and left the bar with still not a word from anyone that worked there. In a way, it ended up being fate since we thought to walk across the street to Stella Blu, and had amazing service and an amazing happy hour. All in all, I don't plan on going back. The food was not good enough to merit another visit, and the service definitely wasn't.

One of the nice things that I liked when I read online about ktop was that each karaoke room has its own bathroom! When I checked out the bathroom in our room the toilet was filled with B L O O D (SERIOUSLY!!) AND the floor was covered in an unpromising liquid substance... I don't know what it was because the floor is black but... I have a bad feeling I wouldn't want to know anyway. When we told someone, they simply flushed the toilet and let us know to be aware that the toilet was broken but we could still use it (???; though to be fair it maybe been a language barrier problem and maybe he couldn't explain what exactly was wrong with our toilet.) He also left the floor covered in whatever that was. Also, I am not exaggerating when I say that it was literally one fourth of the floor was flooded with whatever that ominous liquid was next to the toilet. I ended up requesting a different room, (one wasn't offered to me) and thankfully they complied... But this room wasn't much better. At first glance it looked pretty with the glowing lights and everything but it was very dirty and there was no toilet paper in the bathroom... We ended up having to use the box of tissues (go Kleenex!) that was in the room.The food was...... firstly the online menu is totally different from the actual menu... There was no japchae, no pineapple fried rice, no pad thai, no drunken noodles.... Nothing that could pass as a full entre or even was sized big enough to be shared! Instead we was just overpriced, under (or over) cooked appetizers and a variety of milk teas. An example is the potato shrimp which u have had else where and love- the outside was browned crispy but the inside was soft and pale raw potato... it didn't even cook well to the center... A lot of the food (crab Rangoon, lamb skewers, even the potato shrimp) was cold on arrival. Honestly it was just embarrassing... I can't imagine the chef themselves eating their own food and dm very surprised by the honestly terrible quality of the meals...The karaoke was alright. Quite a few of the songs were just music videos without lyrics and as such, they still had the voices of the actual singers, making it more of an unofficial singalong and somewhat defeating the purpose of karaoke. The song selection could've been a lot better and one of our mics was dead. We asked for another.... it also died. (We were only there for 2.5 hours, too...)

I will not be returning to this establishment, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.

81,"Well let me start off by saying we ended up not getting to eat here. The young man working the bar was very enthusiastic.   We went in for a quick bite & to catch the end of the game - best seats are at the bar so we sat there. I couldn't get a word in. The Bar tender had a whole spiel that took - honestly a really long time. I really just wanted a plain cheeseburger. (We tried to say several times - but he wouldn't let us talk). Then started telling us about the bar specials - I let him know we wouldn't be drinking but if they had Kombucha we'd take one of those. He didn't know what Kombucha was and gave us a hard time about not drinking then walked away - still didn't take our food order. 10 min later he came back and was like by the way we have buckets of beer on special - I again reintegrated we weren't drinking, just some cheeseburgers please. He was like I'll be right back... he was gone... quite a while... we ended up leaving I was starving. Not a great first experience. I'm a little bummed because I've heard the food is great - maybe I'll try another location.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

84,"Love this place. The breakfast is awesome and the lunch is just as good. Come prepared to eat. The weekend can be very busy and has a wait (although it does not seem to be more than 20 minutes). I typically am by myself so I set at the counter which is also a great option if there is just two of you. I asked about reservations. They told me reservations are accepted for parties greater than six.What I really love about this place is they always provide excellent service and as busy as they are they somehow remember what you like form one visit to the next. My favorite is the breakfast with the thick cut bacon. For lunch I enjoy their burgers. Both come with a little extra. The breakfast comes with a pastry basket and the lunch comes with your choice of relishes (coleslaw, beets, macaroni salad). The menu is huge with three pages of choices.One thing I enjoy about sitting at the counter is the buzz of the work and you get to see different things coming by. As well as options and comments from other people trying to decide what they want. Which sometimes leads to good humor as the banter with the wait staff starts expanding. One of the most delightful comments that I have heard by other customers is ""wow that was fast"". This is especially important when you are hungry. When you arrive don't be fooled by the crowd. They do seat people with minimal wait. Parking Lenny's lot can be a challenge if there is a large crowd. However, the old Mazda dealership next door allows customers to park for the overflow.On the weekends kids (I am sure of all ages) can experience ""Mark the Balloon Guy"". His creations are unique and entertaining. You often are met by decorative balloon hats as you are walking in.The atmosphere is family diner at its best. Often the windows are decorated for the Holidays at hand. It is not uncommon for the entire place to be asked to sing ""happy birthday"" for another guest. And the little nuances like the stuffed animal/puppets for sale at the front, the sports theme with the traditional wooden baseball stadium seats for waiting, and the interesting giant stuffed spider that goes up and down when the door leading to the bathrooms opens and closes on the other side of the restaurant.

88,"I visited Prep & Pastry for the first time this year, and I've been about one or three times, give or take. I have to say, I was never really interested whenever I looked at this place because the food was not intriguing to look at. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a go. I can't say I was pleasantly surprised but I also can't say I was disappointed. Some items were a hit, somewhat, and some items were a miss, somewhat. From memory, I had: biscuits & gravy, the dip, classic (french toast but pancake), a dole doughsant, and the brunch punch cocktail. Getting into it-Interior/Exterior: The inside is so cutely decorated! Getting to the location is a bit rough and the parking kind of sucks but you win some you lose some. 4/5Ambiance: It is always busy here! I am not complaining, despite the fact it's always buzzing with people, it never takes too long to be seated. 5/5 Food: Given the price of these items, I would expect a liiiittle more seasoning. I found some of the food a bit bland, don't get me wrong, still palatable but for $14 I would've expected some more of a kick out of the dip. I ordered the classic french toast at one point but they were out and so they offered me a pancake instead. My fault, I'm not really keen on pancakes but they were alright, nonetheless. I didn't finish them though. Their pastries are amazing, no complaints! The alcohol will kick you while you're down, which I appreciate. I've personally had better biscuits and gravy and probably would not order again. 3.5/5Price: A bit overpriced, in my opinion. Maybe it's to add to the vibe but you can easily rack up a bill here for a handful of dishes and a coffee. 3/5 Customer Service: All the waiters, hosts, etc are so nice! 5/5 Overall: A decent place to visit with just about anyone, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. 4/5disclaimer: these are delayed reviews.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

90,Party of 4. First time eating. Ultimate fail. The menu was Uber confusing and in very small print. Everything is ala carte which is not really explained well. They make it sound like the veggies are big enough to share but it's more like a tapas situation. The best thing we ate was the sweet potato which was melt in your mouth but heavy on the paprika. The chicken had a great sauce to accompany it but the chicken was tough and over cooked. The crispy rice was bland but there was a bit of cranberry that kinda of helped. The ice cream had some weird salt on it that destroyed it. The custard was great. The potatoes were decent. Had a nice yogurt sauce that made the dish. The 6 dollar greens were bitter. The beet salad was over seasoned and the beets were hard. It was just a whole shit show for the amount we paid. We left irritated and unsatisfied.  We voiced our complaints and most of the dishes were whisked away half eaten and unfinished. The manager did come to speak to us but nothing was done to rectify the matter. One dish was removed from the ticket but everything else remainned. There was no real attempt at rectifying the matter. I did enjoy my one drink but it was such a bad experience I didn't order another cocktail. What was the point ya know.

Since we didn't actually dine-in, I'm not comfortable discussing the interior ambience, but will talk about the coffee and food. I got a small vanilla latte, and was very satisfied with the result. Just the right sweetness and coffee levels for me in a vanilla latte, and not too hot to burn my tongue first sip, but warm enough to last me the next 20.

I don't prefer community seating, but it is well done here and not too much of a turn off. Drink: sigh. The cocktail list is limited and the bartender does not invite collaboration to ensure that the customer receives a satisfactory (and expensive) cocktail. The first time we visited there were one a few cocktails and all contained gin and whisky, a gin and tea cocktail sounded tasty but I dislike gin so I asked if vodka or bourbon could be substituted-- an eye roll and a 'I will see if the bartender will do this' later and I am stuck with a lackluster cocktail. Later visits revealed an equally disappointing list (the drinks are just poorly conceived) and still few and unimpressive wine options. Food:  the most disappointing. Many of the dishes sound delicious and we have tried quite a few, but expect for the steak they have all been very poorly executed. Dry and bland tamales, undercooked beets, sloppy stew-type entrees and fishy ceviche. Service: we have had both great and not so great experiences. My biggest gripe is the insistence that food come out 'tapas style' which, at treehouse, means one dish at a time. My boyfriend and I went for a late night bite at 11, he ordered the frito pie and I ordered the tamales.

Second (take out) visit, I ordered two Tacos, Nachos, Quesadilla and another Burrito.  Wasn't impressed with the nachos or quesadilla (only cheese, scraps of chicken and very salty nachos) The burrito tasted different (same portion size) and it had too much rice inside.

97,"Located off 10th street and 76 ave, another city hidden gem! Part of a new medical building, outdoor appearence screams modern but when you walk in you felt you have hit some version of Time Machine that has taken you elsewhere in Alberta. Gives you a feel of Elk Island /Kananaskis Mountain/lake outdoor feel- Indoors. Definitely not the cabin feel but like your on a porch facing a lake/mountain. With a Vintage feel, wood crafted art pieces and decor, with colourful curtains and cushions infused throughout the cafe. Mason jars for chandeliers! Freshly made is their baked goods, soups and sandwiches, using produce from Local Farmers and Markets. Its always a busy place, but if not shy or on your own you can share a table with strangers and become friends. Wifi is free and there have been many, including myself that have chosen to use it as alternative office space. Fun place to take a friend, or friends. Good for families,space may be very limiting for strollers, so leave those on the side but still come in. Live bands now play and hallelujah, they now open later than normal! They have a book exchange area, and also a community scarf/blanket project where you can pick up where some left off on their knitting and then leave it for the next person. I found that it was the best place for all ages to appreciate something vintage in a modern world where social media has taken over. This place makes you feel like you SHOULD put away your phone and pick up a hot cup of java and actually talk to the person next to you while enjoying the decor/ live show (when on). Street parking is available with office hours so you may have to park a block away and walk. There is underground parking that you can use as well.I was able to meet Shammy one of the owners of this creative interactive space. Extremely pleasant and social, appreciative of all her customers. She was actually hosting and serving the whole time i was there! and I've been there more than once!Now lets talk about the food. Farmer's market fresh I was able to have the House Soup, a medley of veggies and chicken with home made broth. Tasty and well portioned. Over a bit of time I caved and went over to try their homemade whoopie pie. No disappointment there. Advice- cave and just order!

105,"Simply incredible... and I'm not just talking about the Banh Mi sandwiches! I arrived a little before closing time, and having just driven 10ish hours from San Antonio I was starving and exhausted. Suffice to say, I was not in a friendly or gregarious mood. Nonetheless, when I entered I could sense something uplifting about this establishment. The owners greeted me and asked how I was - not all that unique, but what stood out to me was how genuine they were. I truly felt that they cared about my responses, how I was after such a long drive, and how they could help. It was the best customer service I have had in years, and if you have read my other yelp reviews, then you know how important customer service is to me. Easily a 5 star sandwich and coffee shop - and I didn't even get to the food! I ordered a lemongrass chicken and beef banh mi, and let me tell you - it was amazing! I love the taste of lemongrass and they did not shy away from that flavor. The bread was clearly high quality (I've come to realize that many banh mi sandwiches have meh bread, which hurts the sandwich), and coupling that with the strong lemongrass, juicy chicken, cilantro and cucumber - absolutely dynamite. I then had the beef banh mi much later, and wow was that beef tender and packed with flavor! The jalapeno, like in any solid banh mi, gives a great kick, and each bite had my taste buds dancing. As they were preparing my (delicious) banh mi's, I mentioned that I will probably continue to drive to Los Angeles, so I should order a coffee. The Vietnamese Coffee was delectable, and on top of that they gave me a free iced coffee, just to make sure that I'll be awake for the ride. (Again, the remarkable customer service cannot be overstated.)The only thing I'm upset about is that I don't live in Tucson!! I am clearly Banhdicted and I encourage all who like great customer service and fantastic sandwiches and coffee to check this place out. It's going to quickly become your go-to sandwich and coffee spot. To the owner's - you're amazing!

I love beer, breweries, and it is on the way home...so why not?!?! The parking lot was pretty packed on a Monday afternoon. We were approached by the beer tour guides to see if we were interested in a tour. We ended up opting for the 10 dollar fresh day tour. There is a free tour, but with this tour you get a fresh bottle of Bud to bring home and the tour is longer. We killed time before our tour walking through their museum. So when the tour began we were excited. To be honest, one guide was great while the other one seemed like he was reading everything from a script. As for beer samples, you get two dixie cups of bud or bud light and a full glass of one of their beers at the end. Don't even ask for a refill cause you will get a big fat no.

Yes, you read that right, 4 tacos for $39  + $4 extra for avocado which they forgot to put on the tacos. Ouch, and they were not even good tacos. The grouper pieces were almost absent -- hidden under mostly dry lettuce & cabbage; definitely not what I expected. The wait staff was very apologetic about the long kitchen delay; stating their kitchen staff was new.  But that's a management issue, not a kitchen issue.

111,"I've been to this Hudsons maybe a dozen times (or less) over the past few years for different types of gatherings - usually dancey dance birthday parties or after an ESSC game for free wings. In all honestly, I'd never gone to this or any other Hudsons specifically for a meal until this week. We had gotten a $25 gift certificate from ESSC that was about to expire. Can't waste free food! My review for this specific experience: Went on a Monday right after work. It wasn't busy. Confusing combo of sports on TV and Lady gaga et al on the speakers. Our waitress was good, professional if not anything else. I didn't really want anything on the menu, but I got the guacamole bacon burger. The first half was alright.

Once I got into the second half, I became overwhelmed with some sort of sickly sweet orange sauce on it that just made me totally nauseated. I couldn't finish it.

Separate them using commas. context: I've been to this Hudsons maybe a dozen times (or less) over the past few years for different types of gatherings - usually dancey dance birthday parties or after an ESSC game for free wings. In all honestly, I'd never gone to this or any other Hudsons specifically for a meal until this week. We had gotten a $25 gift certificate from ESSC that was about to expire. Can't waste free food! My review for this specific experience: Went on a Monday right after work. It wasn't busy. Confusing combo of sports on TV and Lady gaga et al on the speakers. Our waitress was good, professional if not anything else. I didn't really want anything on the menu, but I got the guacamole bacon burger. The first half was alright.

114,"Friends of ours recommended this new restaurant that is right next to the Charcoal Pit on 202. They said they really enjoyed their meal, so we decided to give this place a chance last Saturday. We went in for a late lunch/ early dinner around 4:45pm. There was only one other table in there, so we had the place to ourselves. This gave us a chance to walk around and check things out. The decor is different for an Italian place. There are no paintings of Venice on the walls, thank god! Each table has a guidebook of Italy tourist spots, so you can check things out while you browse the menu. Our waitress was very welcoming and gave her recommendations. The menu is very simple, nothing fancy. We started with the fried calamari. It was very good, not chewy at all. My only complaint was that it was served on top of the marinara sauce. This caused the breading to become soggy. Ask for it on the side. For entrees we had the chicken parm and penne alla vodka. The rigatoni and penne pasta is made fresh in house. The vodka sauce was somewhat different than what I am used to. It was a lighter cream color, and didn't seem to have any prosciutto in it. Either way it was excellent. The dish also came with 3 breaded chicken cutlets. The pieces of chicken were off to the side sitting on top of their house marinara sauce. It was a little odd, having the two sauces on one plate, but the chicken was really good, so I'm not complaining. The chicken parm was basically the same cutlets I had, only bigger, with parm cheese on it. The house red sauce was good. We didn't get dessert, as the entrees are very large here. You will more than likely be taking some of it home. Our bill, including two glasses of wine ($8 each) was only $54. The prices are very fair. Hands down the best Italian on 202.

This was very nice because the ladies get to take their shoes off [: There was also a small window between our VIP area and the bar behind the wall so you could order drinks through it like a drive-thru type thing. The bouncers were kind enough to let us take over this section even though we hadn't reserved it :P The entire VIP area is separated by a huge door so getting in is difficult if the bouncer isn't too fond of you.. Shots are in the 5 dollar range and margaritas were only 3 I think.. Overall I think this is a great place if you like to go out for a night of dancing.

128,"My first time enjoying ""Burrito Libre"" was ordering it from skip the dishes, I don't have much to say about the dining experience there. You are offered a minimal amount of ingredients that you can stuff into your burrito but they are quite unique with the flavours of there proteins! There salsas and sauces are also unique and flavourful. For the guacamole and chips I think they need a little bit more seasoning (more salt and pepper). The price is pretty decent and on the cheaper side for Sherwood park (10.00$ for a large burrito). I enjoy eating from the place but it needs to have more selection of toppings that are enjoyed in a burrito to compete with the other Mexican restaurants.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

130,"THE SERVICEOur first waiter Ed was awesome! If we could just review him, this would be 5-stars. He was attentive, helpful and funny. We were bummed he had to leave mid-meal (but it happens) and then it was sort of like our table was ghosted. We received our next dishes without issue but then no one followed up with us quite a while and we wanted to order desserts and get our check. The other challenge with service was pacing based on the size of our table. We were at a small high top near the bar. First of all, there were no hooks under the table to hang a purse so we were sort of stuck with either bags on the ground or tucked behind our back. The table was small (high tops usually are) and all the plates we ordered would be brought out at once. There'd be no space on the table to move drinks. It was precarious at times. Next time, instead of ordering 3-4 plates at once, I'd do one or two at a time to prevent that from happening again. THE LOCATION Full disclosure: I'm a MidTown/Downtown girl, so Zeppelin is a trek for me. I wish it was closer to the hustle and bustle of the heart of Reno. Their location is way out in the suburbs of South Reno so I won't be able to be a regular. There is plenty of parking so you don't need to worry about that. THE COCKTAILS ordered The Devil's Mouth-a fruity jalapeño margarita-first. Fair warning: the spicy salt rim is SPICY. When you get a big helping of it, it's definitely a shock to the system. That said, I loved the cocktail itself which had the slightest hint/kick of jalapeño. Next time, I'd get it without the spicy rim. The second cocktail was somewhat of my own design. I added whiskey to their Lavender Lemonade from the mocktail menu. I was hoping the lavender lemonade would be very distinctive, but it just tasted like lemonade and whiskey. I didn't dislike it at all! It just didn't blow my mind. DINNER Salma and I went wild ordering lots of shareable plates. The Tempura Green Beans were a surprise hit. They are basically green been French fries with a fancy aioli. The Short Rib tacos were a hit. Easily one of the best plates of the night. We also ordered half a dozen oysters. I'm always skeptical of oysters in Nevada, but I'm open to being surprised. Unfortunately, the oysters seems a little warm to me. They were served over ice but they just didn't have that crispness that I expect from great oysters. I've been spoiled by my time on the east coast. The rotational pizza (their weekly social) was phenomenal! We couldn't finish it so I took home leftovers for sure. The pizza was hot, cheesy and covered in toppings. I would definitely get another flatbread here. The Lamb Skewers served with their tzatziki-style sauce were like lamb meatballs. I found them to be over salted and I lost the ability to enjoy the flavors of everything else in the dish. Once again, not bad. But I think the flavors need a little refining personally. DESSERT I love the way they do dessert. You use a piece of paper and a pencil to check off what you want to order on a list. The servings are fairly small so you don't feel too indulgent. I definitely recommend the Bourbon Caramel Brownies and the Blueberry Cheesecake. WRAP UPI would come here again for sure! It's got a nice ambiance and it's not too loud. There are some great drink, dinner and dessert items. And all of the staff members we engaged with were wonderful! That said, it's three stars because it didn't blow me out of the water the way some of my other favorite places in Reno have.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

132,"This is such a cool place! Three words was all it took to add this gem to my list of places to visit while in St. Louis - ""Good Burger Car!!"" YES! They have the car from the movie Good Burger! A movie I was obsessed with as a child &, have since, gotten my kids to love just as much! The place is made out of cool, colorful shipping containers, with many neat decorations, what looks like an alien spaceship from Toy Story with a laser on it adorned the top of the place along with a cow. Now, on to the food. They have many different options to choose from including create-your-own burgers & many of their own creations, sandwiches, salads, sides, kid's meals, & shakes & floats. I had a single burger and added fried egg, bacon, & pepper jack. It was an amazing burger! There were some things that took a star away from what could have been a 5-star rating however. Number one, parking! This could just be a common thing in St. Louis, but parking was VERY limited. Their tiny parking lot was full, no street parking anywhere near by, & there is a parking lot behind the place that was only for residential parking, sign specifically stating not for restaurant parking or cars would be towed at owner's expense. Wasn't the best idea, but we took the chance anyway as we couldn't find any parking anywhere else, & luckily, our vehicle was not towed! I definitely do not suggest this for anyone though. Another draw back, the place is not specifically a ""drive-in"", in the common meaning of a drive-in, it did have indoor seating, however it was HOT as could be inside the building, very crowded, & extremely NOISY! Could barely even hear the cashier taking our order at the counter. There is outdoors seating, which is where we chose to eat our meal, even though it was a pretty warm day. Still felt better outside than in. The burgers we ordered were absolutely delicious, however the fries we chose to go with were not good at all. Cold & tasted overcooked. They did have a tasty seasoning on them though, & probably would have been great had they been a bit more fresh. Was definitely worth the stop however, even if just to get some photos of the Good Burger car with my children. They were so excited about this! Honestly not sure who was more excited, my sons or their father! Such a unique place & worth a visit! They also sell souvenir T-shirts & hats, & my fianc had to get himself a ""HI AF"" shirt.

133,"This was the first time I have been to Jones in a few years since I moved back to Philly.  A few years back, I remember loving Jones, especially their mac and cheese and chicken and waffles.  I loved how they had so many comfort food dishes, like their chicken pot pie and thanksgiving dish.  Unfortunately, this time I went back to Jones, I was pretty disappointed.  I feel like the quality, taste, and presentation of a lot of the food has declined significantly.  The mac and cheese used to be one of my favorites, but this time I had it, it literally tasted like it was taken from the box, just baked.  I was also really disappointed in the fried chicken that accompanied the waffle.  I'm not sure if it's just that other restaurants have really perfected their fried chicken recipes or if Jones' dish just got worse. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and just surprised it didn't taste better.  It also looked more like diner food compared to before.  I remember it being a more upscale food presentation, but the food the time I most recently went was not well-presented.  I was also unimpressed with the fact that I ordered a cocktail and my glass came back only filled up half-way with the cocktail.  If I'm paying cocktail prices, I definitely want a full glass or get a smaller glass.  The appearance of a half-empty glass really also turned me off.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

As far as the club and kitchen, I'm only giving it 3 stars simply because I didn't sample the food there and was only drinking beer. I can' really judge the cooking or the bartending skills at this point. Next time I'll hit up some the BB-Q and some margaritas then renew my review.Lots of parking across the street is a plus."

Then a guy approached me and asked me if i would sing at the atomic cowboy. After resisting he offered me a $300 advance. I took it! Will be setting up date soon.

142,This place had a nice vibe. We sat outside. I was underwhelmed by the flight because each drink tasted more like the syrup flavor. The oysters were super good though. They almost took me back to New Orleans. The bulto go tacos were good and filling. Lots of different flavors there. I'd have like more of a crisp on the steak. The chocolate mousse cake surprised me but was pretty good.,,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

143,"Great boutique and coffee shop on the far eastside. The part of a great program to assist women who are exiting sex trafficking. There is a boutique that has lots of clothing and accessories for ladies. The prices are reasonable and the quality of the merchandise is high. The coffee shop is fantastic. It has a variety of coffees (all the usuals -- latte, drip, espresso, cappuccino, etc.). They also have hot and cold chai latte (I was told they are wonderful by my wife and son). The menu also includes steamers and a large variety of lattes. There is a cooler with soft drinks and water. They also sell 10-12 (I can't remember) varieties of Sundaes ice cream (which is the best ice cream in town, IMO). They also have some baked goods (scones and the like).

I will definitely be back.","great program, boutique, clothing, accessories",,"great program, boutique, clothing, accessories","They have a program to assist women who are exiting sex trafficking.

144,"Coming to New Orleans and not eating at Commander's Palace is like going to Paris and not visiting the Louvre. It's not just a meal but a memorable experience. WHAT WE ORDERED: the 3 course coolinary dinner, consisting of a 3 sample soup (turtle soup, gumbo du jour, and chef's seasonal soup), the black skillet seared gulf fish and the creole bread pudding souffle. We also ordered the pecan-crusted gulf fish and a glass of von hovel white wine.Out of the soups, the gumbo du jour was our favorite. The pecan-crusted gulf fish was divine. The creamy crushed-corn sauce that came with it wonderfully complimented the crunchiness of the pecan crust. The seared gulf fish was also complimented by a great, spicy, smoked tomato vinaigrette sauce. The bread pudding souffle was the most unique. It was topped with a bourbon sauce that added an extra level of sophistication to this traditional dessert.After our meal, our waiter, Todd, was kind enough to give us a tour of the estate, a perfect way to cap a perfect meal. Thanks to him we learned about the history of the restaurant as well as the craftsmanship that went into making every one of its dining rooms feel like a different setting altogether. The garden room has floor-to-ceiling panes of glass that overlook the patio, while the main dining room downstairs has hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana as well as electric chandeliers, each worth $10,000, with lights that flicker and move as if they were candle flames. Todd also gave us a tour of the red wine collection, and the cellar room that can host a private party surrounded by their extensive collection of wine bottles. One of the cellar rooms is kept locked at all times because the wine bottles in there are so old that they shouldn't be moved, and obviously expensive ($6000 / per bottle). We also got to see the adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener. Needless to say, the service was excellent. Todd really gave us a new appreciation for the restaurant and made us feel as if we were family.Another lovely detail about our meal was that all of the ingredients for the pecan-crusted gulf fish came within a 50-mile radius, while most of the ingredients that make up the dishes on the menu come within a 100-mile radius. The open kitchen, which guests are welcome to walk through, features a list of the local ingredients used in the meals. TIP: For an excellent briefing on commander's palace, ask for Todd as your waiter! For the most scenic seating, ask for a table overlooking the patio in the upstairs garden room.","tour, estate, tour, red wine collection, cellar room, their extensive collection, adjacent garden","floor-to-ceiling panes of glass, hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana, electric chandeliers,","tour, estate, tour, red wine collection, cellar room, their extensive collection, adjacent garden, floor-to-ceiling panes of glass, hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana, electric chandeliers,","They have an adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener.","The restaurant has an adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener.",list what is atypical in the restaurant.

145,"Excellent. But, don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Go ahead and be critical while you're at it because you will find something wrong with Bern's. It just won't be the quality of the food and most likely won't be the service. You can pick on the decor though since it's a relatively easy target. The building is quite unattractive: white painted stucco and no windows. It may as well be a Wal-Mart. Also, the interior is dark and a bit gaudy-ish so be prepared for that. Hype often leaves me feeling that something is over-rated and I tend to find reasons to support that view. Bern's, however, pretty much lives up to it's name. The food is extremely high quality, the service is impeccable, and if you like wine, you will have more choices than you could ever sample in a lifetime including some extremely rare vintages. The menu is as thick as an encyclopedia and contains useful information about aging meat, suggestions for cooking preferences, and the reasons why their beautiful, well-fed beef is superior to anything you've ever experienced before. The more you know about something, the easier it is to make an informed choice and while the menu is biased, there is definitely a lot of valuable information in it. Take some time to read through it if you've never done so or better yet, check it out before you go if you can. The wine list is more like a wine book. Bern's claims the largest wine selection in the world. If that's not true, it's probably pretty close. You may be offered a tour of the wine cellar where you can see quite a bit of the collection for yourself, including the special wines which are kept under lock and key. Well, it's a $2 lock and key but that still qualifies. We dined with someone who hates french onion soup but he actually finished an entire bowl of it and commented that it was excellent. It was definitely delicious as were the mini crisp-breads accompanying the soup. I'm not a fan of caviar but if you fancy that, you'll find several choices here. I definitely prefer a grown fish over its eggs. Wild salmon and they will tell you exactly which cold waters it originated from whether it's Alaska, Scotland, Norway, etc. Considering what comes with each entree, the meals are fairly reasonably priced. The sides aren't stingy. You get a decently sized portion of veggies or whatever side you order. The quality of beef and fish is outstanding and the flavors are delicious. Expect to pay close to $40 for a salmon entree which comes with soup, vegetables, and a starch (rice or potato). The steaks are priced according to weight and there is quite a range. Again, I suggest checking out the menu beforehand since it contains a lot of useful information. Save room and make a reservation for dessert upstairs where a party of up to 4 can fit at a cozy table nestled inside a converted wine cask. Choose your music and use the telephone on the wall to call your server if you need to. Bern's is not shy about boasting. Not only have they staked claim to the best beef, and the largest wine collection in the world, but they also offer ""The Best Sundae in the World"" with homemade macadamia nut ice cream created from a recipe that took 7 years to perfect. Not sure if it really is the best sundae in the world but I will say that the ice cream is delicious and probably some of the tastiest I've ever had. This is a destination restaurant where it is worth celebrating life events like birthdays and anniversaries. If I were a man and wanted to propose to the woman of my dreams, I would bring her here for dinner, reserve a table in the dessert room, have that macadamia nut sundae come out with a ring on top and get down on my knee. Really. If you're going to propose in a restaurant, this is one I would definitely recommend. Of course she loves you so much that it doesn't matter where you propose but this will definitely tip the scales in your favor and she is always going to remember it. The candlelight makes you look even more gorgeous and the service and food will probably be amazing enough to make up for it even if you're not your usual super charming self. Take a happy little tour through the wine cellar and kitchen after dinner before heading up to the dessert room. You can carry your wine glass on the tour which makes it even more fun. That little walk will get the endorphins flowing and make it easy and exciting for her to accept your marriage proposal. If you go, you absolutely must make a reservation. We went on a Tuesday night which we thought wouldn't require a reservation but there was an hour wait at 6:30 pm. We stayed in the bar area until a table was ready and the wait ended up being much less than an hour. Overall, an excellent dining experience with delicious high-quality food and superior service.",tour,,tour,They may offer a tour of the wine cellar.,The restaurant may offer a tour of the wine cellar.,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

147,"Heard about this place on DDD on Food Network and got excited to see if a place could actually make a Tamale comparable to my Mom's. I will travel anywhere for great food and a great experience and this seemed to have it all. Great food from the Mexican husband AND THEN a fusion of the styles with his in-laws as part of the business. After I posted on Facebook that I would be coming here my friends gave recommendations and prepared me for awesomeness.I even convinced my pregnant wife to travel 1+ hours down to Indianapolis, after the Indianapolis State Fair, to eat here for dinner. We got even more excited when we got there and we could tell that they had renovated and updated their look since the show had aired with bright green colors and the workers wearing matching outfits and headbands. From there it was down hill.The young, blonde, male worker rolled his eyes as came in through the door and approached the counter. Being newbies we had a tough time with the menu but got no assistance, only a blank stare wondering why we had bothered to come bother him on the weekend. Understanding that their food is really good and once it is gone.. it is gone. They even put a big screen tv up in front of the register to tell you what flavors they had remaining. I don't feel stupid because instinct has you looking at their main board for the menu offerings and everyone that came in after us made the same mistake. Yats Cajun has a similar method but they erase the menu item that they have run out of. HINT HINTBefore I could complete my order, with the young and obviously annoyed dude, part of my order was ready for payment at another register? I had not completed my order and I was being asked to pay... This caused even more confusion as we were trying to order for my wife and my 5 and 3 yrs old.I had 2 options for tamales. Chicken in green salsa and some other option. IT wasnt bad but it was not what DDD described as way more meat and filling than masa. A good tamale has enough masa to hold it together but not too much where it masks the flavor of the filling. I gave it to the kids as they didn't really mind bland and minimally flavored food. They couldn't tell the difference between the chicken chunks and the giant mound of masa I chiseled out for them. I also got 2 tacos Steak and Pork. Steak was dry and not what a steak taco should be. Saving grace was the tortilla... sad. Guacamole was stringy and old as it hangs out in plastic containers that sit in a shelf all day. Guac has to be made fresh in order for it to stand out as being good. GOOD ABOUT THE PLACEPork was very good and juicy. Tortillas are very good. Chips were amazing.This is the First time I have been disappointed in visiting a place I saw on TV. Maybe going in during the day shift or during the week instead of a Sunday in the afternoon would change that up? Maybe annoyed dude hates working the weekend? Or maybe during the day the actual folks that were on the program are there when the good reviews come in? You can obviously tell that their values are not shared by everyone on their staff including annoyed dude. Everywhere else I have gone that is featured on the show I have had a great time with. I have even gotten a chance to talk to the owners at Camp Washington in Cincinnati. This was not one of those times.

152,"Totally grateful for Jack's Firehouse for taking a party of 8 last minute during brunch hours on a Saturday. Went here after completing the half marathon and I was starving!HIGHLY recommend the lobster Mac & cheese. They don't skimp out in the lobster and it was just simply delicious. Good enough portion too. I also really enjoyed the crab Benedict! Very satisfying choice as well. I don't recommend the steak and eggs. It was just lacking in taste for me. I ordered a mimosa. Let me tell you - bartender didn't make it primarily orange juice lol. If you like it strong, you came to the right place. I personally didn't like it that strong so I had to add more orange juice to mine.Service was great. Got all our orders correct and in a timely manner. My friend requested to have her cocktail made differently and the bartender was able to accommodate. Bathrooms were clean but not fond of the wooden doors stalls with the hook. (I know, I'm weird for commenting on the bathroom but this is important to me! Haha)I would come back to Jack's if I'm in Fairmount again.

153,"Shoreline is right- we enjoyed our beach side, self seated high top. It was a half moon wooden table protruding from the wall but given the 25 minute wait for a table it worked just fine for us.Really you can't go wrong with a view quite like that. Sunbathers were laying out on the sand in front of the restaurant and beyond them was the gorgeous waves crashing on the shore. We watched kite surfers and jet powered surfboard surfers cruise the water on this windy day. The fresh air, and dolphin spotting makes this place a delight. There is an overhang to provide shade or you can soak up the sun. A walk up ordering station is around the corner from the self seating area or you can choose to have table service by seeing the hostess. We did self serve and only stopped in for a drink. I can understand why some said it's pricey but with a view like that, I think it's worth the price. A house glass of wine is $7- I really don't think that's bad. Also the portions looked substantial from what I could see and the waitresses were all very friendly. Tons of locals turn up here and I can see why.

155,"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou! I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. I've gone for all different types of visits. I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration. This place has it all. I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi. The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want. I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have. Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money. In addition there is a lot of space to sit. Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety. They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day. I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive. Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails. For the most part, everything is modestly priced. This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers. It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue. I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend.

157,It was about time that UCity got a non ubiquitous chain coffee shop closer to campus. Came here a lot when it first opened and they have really evolved beyond just a cafe with great espresso & pastries. Reasons to love Lovers & Madmen:1. BAM!

I recommend their Vanilla Chai (Soy/Dairy are both good)5. Great space & bright clean decor. Comfy couches that are great to snug up for a read. 6.

158,"I'm addicted to the smoothies here. They make me feel like a glowing goddess, full of light energy and goji berries. The menu is impressive, spanning many different types of cuisine in a vegan rendering. My one problem is the price- The smoothies come out to $8 plus tax, which make this place more of a special treat for me rather than a morning routine, which it could be if the prices were about 25% lower. This trend spans the rest of the menu, which is unfortunate because while I love their mission and I really want to support this place more often, I balk at the prices and end up shying away from ever trying anything substantial. However, I understand that the pricing is due to the quality of the ingredients and the costs of running a very niche restaurant (not to be confused with Niche, the restaurant), so I chalk up my 8+ dollars and indulge as often as I can. I love PuraVegan because it's such a refreshing change of pace in a place like St. Louis, where things like ""pork steak"" rule and ravioli is deep-fried and BBQ is a lunch staple. I really like the people who work here, and they host donation yoga classes, which is so awesome.

159,"I'm really conflicted about what to rate Urban Shabu. The menu items were extensive but as other reviewers mentioned, the portions the staff give you are very inconsistent and therefore it gets confusing when you want to order more. For instance, we ordered what we thought were several orders of the shittake mushrooms, but received literally about 5-6. We upped the ante on our next order and doubled our original order, but didn't receive ANY the next round, or the round after that. We think they ran out, but they could have at least informed us. Aside from this, I enjoyed that everyone gets their own individual hot pot and soup base. The sauce station is also extensive and I like that it's DIY. Oh, and the seat covers to keep your jackets from getting smelly is a nice touch. I probably would have rated Urban Shabu 4 or 4.5, but the one thing that REALLY turned us off from our meal was the huge cockroach we saw scampering up the wall less than 1 foot away from us about 15 minutes before we were about to leave. It was disgusting. I'm not talking about a tiny bug either, but a full size cockroach. We heard that the restaurant upstairs has (had?) infestation problems in the past, but that's certainly no excuse for Urban Shabu. It's a shame because this place was a fairly good hot pot restaurant too. That said, I'd probablyyyyyy come back (ack! I'm saying this very hesitantly).. but not before they fix some major issues: bugs and portion standardization.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

164,"On a business trip to St. Louis, I was looking for a place to grab a cocktail and a burger. My manager told me to check this place out and recommended a few items on the menu to scratch that itch. I arrived here on a Tuesday around 5:30pm and was immediately impressed by the surrounding area in St. Charles where this restaurant is located. I was able to find a parking spot just a short walk away. Immediately upon walking in, I really admired the trendy interior. Walking up to the hostess station, I told them I was here to grab dinner and didn't need a table so they showed me to the bar and I was able to grab a seat without any problems. To start, I had a young woman wait on me. She was nice enough but she seemed annoyed and flustered so she wasn't the ""warmest"" waitress I've interacted with. She was bustling though making several cocktails and filling multiple drink orders so I understood. One of the items my manager told me to order was a cocktail: Fire at Rickhouse - Buffalo Trace bourbon, maple syrup, orange bitters, angostura bitters, served in an oak-wood smoked glass.  It was cool watching her make and serve this! The cocktail was phenomenal though, it went down so smooth and every time I took a sip, I smelled the oak-wood. I made sure to savor that drink through the whole dinner. For dinner, again, I went with my manager's recommendation: the Prasino Burger, cooked medium, with a side of cauliflower gratin (a $2 upcharge). The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly: juicy, tender, with a little pink in the center. The toppings on this were delicious too. The smoked Gouda cheese balanced the tomato jam, pickled onions, and arugula and everything just worked! The cauliflower gratin was an awesome side as it had a cake-like consistency and the flavor was great with that white cheddar truffle on top. The amount of food for the prices was pretty reasonable as well, though I still felt *a little* hungry afterward. At this point I got another waiter, a young gentleman, who was much friendlier and fun to talk to. He brought over the dessert menu and after reading it over a few times, he helped me decide to go for the Banana Bread Pudding.  This was a solid recommendation.  I really enjoyed the various textures and the mild taste of banana throughout the entire dish without being too sweet.  I liked the fact too that it didn't come off ""heavy"" as in I didn't feel like I needed to run a couple miles afterward!  haha All-in-all, I had a nice experience at Prasino!  Next time, I'd like to try one of their dinner entrees with a Fire at Rickhouse.  Of course, if I had someone with me, I'd want to try their short-rib nachos on their happy hour menu too.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

168,"Visited here earlier for a coffee break with a few co-workers, and we really, really enjoyed it.When you walk in the door from the rear parking lot, you come off the new deck and are greeted by reclaimed wide wooden floors that we later learned used to be Al Gore's tobacco barn. Seriously.The folks from Magdalene have done a terrific job with their choices in lighting fixtures, seating, decor - across the board. I especially loved the chandeliers that are teacup collections representing a larger story you'll have to read once you visit. I totally smelled a pinterest post in my future... and if you've ever seen folks taking an old antique door and turning that into a coffee table... they've done that, too, up front in between comfy couches. I had a chai latte. It was good, not the best one I've ever had, but good. Their selections of sandwiches and salads looked so tempting that as I left, I grabbed a Turkey Club ($7) and tomato cucumber salad ($3) for lunch - that now that I have enjoyed, I now love this place.(I do realize their sandwiches and salads are provided by a third party... that's OK... they're still good and benefiting a good cause).The coffee is a la Just Love Coffee out of Murfreesboro, another company I thoroughly enjoy.I even brought back a dessert that is vegan and gluten free, and I thought to myself I know I won't like it, but wanted to try. I sound like Mikey, I know, I liked it! My choice is a cookie that is an Oreo sandwich - basically two large chocolate dense cookies almost like a brownie sandwiching white cream. Vegan, gluten free, whatever, it's good and a bargain at only $3. BIG cookie. Still enjoying as I write this cookie. Will still be enjoying at 4 pm cookie.I love that the paper studio where the women of the program are making journals and gift tags, etc. is right there, and I love that they also sell their candles, lip balms, etc. How often can you combine a coffee fix, birthday gift shopping errand, and support a local charity all at once?I know I'll be back.

169,"The big draw of this place is the excellent pizza, which you can have with beer on an outside deck with a view of parklands. It's a nice place to hang out on a sunny afternoon. You can even go for a walk in the Goose Creek Park behind the restaurant afterwards to burn off the calories you just consumed. The big minus is that if you go for lunch or in early afternoon, the menu is really limited. ""Grill"" is a misnomer - should really be called Goose Creek Pizza and Salad because that, along with a few pedestrian sandwich and appetizer choices, is all they offer before 4:30 pm. The menu had a whole page of entrees that looked tasty, but are only served after 4:30 pm. Since we were there before 4:30 pm, we didn't get to eat any, and I'm not sure I want to go back in the evening when it's probably more crowded and less fun to eat outdoors. The pizza selections are interesting - everything from bacon cheeseburger to various veggie and cheese combos - and the crust is very good, better than Uno's up the street. It would be nice if Goose Creek had a choose-your-own-toppings option as I don't think I saw one. The beer selection is OK - not a lot on tap, a few more selections in the bottle. I think Uno's up the street beats them there. This place also seems to attract a goodly number of families with kids at lunch times, probably because it serves pizza and there's a playground in the adjoining park, so be aware that you'll probably be swigging back your beer with someone's little Muffy and Joshie scampering past your table. Of course, after the second or third beer, you probably won't care.","parklands, Goose Creek Park, playground",Uno's,"parklands, Goose Creek Park, playground, Uno's","They have an outside deck with a view of the parklands.

170,"I have not been here in so long, but a few friends wanted to come and so we met them. Everything seemed pleasant upon arrival, and I was shocked to remember just how small the inside of the restaurant is. Outside there's a great patio, but not for July at least for me! (In fact, when we left it was a gentleman setting up for live music!)I will begin by saying, the service here was just not up to par. First off, we never got any bread until the food arrived as they kept telling us it was being baked. Then I had to flag down the waiter just to get butter. We also had a flag him down to get our drinks refilled. Our friends said how sweet the server was... But in my opinion, he wasn't the best at getting things out to us. I had eggplant Parmesan and a caprice salad that I shared with my partner. The caprice was beautiful in presentation. But nothing on it had any flavor; the tomatoes were flat, lack luster with no robust flavor and I couldn't even detect any basil at all. The eggplant Parmesan was pretty tasty, but the marinara sauce that came on the spaghetti was sour and could have used a little fresh herbs - - again my opinion. Our guests had a Cesar salad, a bowl of spaghetti, and chicken with risotto, and a sauce. They had no complaints about their food. Finally we shared spumoni and a slice of custard pie. The pie was on the dry side and the spumoni in my opinion was pretty tasty, but my partner didn't care for it much at all. So overall, I will come back and give it another shot because the servers were all friendly and came by often. The gentleman outside was very friendly and invited us back! But I will say that both my partner and I had funky tummies that night.

172,"""So good that we came here twice and bought a t-shirt"" This was probably one of the top 3 restaurants for my wife and I. We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You're getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don't feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won't be disappointed. You don't have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It's basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I'll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I've read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That's something to experience and boy were they on to something. I'm from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We'll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren't typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn't generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again. This tells me that it was easy and fun to drink. That is what she enjoys. Service: What I have noticed from my 10 days in nola that most restaurants will have a team of people that are taking care of you and at butcher this is no exception. They exceeded and welcomed us as travelers and not as tourists. We enjoyed some great conversations about the beers and they are very open about talking about life after the storm. They shared about the healing was happening and the community that came together and built everything back up. They spoke extremely well of chef Donald link (co owner) which speaks to the gratitude and loyalty they have to one another.

Of course, we had to start off with chips and salsa+Carne Asada Fries to hld us off. The fries are one of the best fusions you will ever taste. They come out fresh smothered in cheese, guacamole, steak and some other less important ingredients. They fantastic. For my main meal I tried the duck taco and two fried fish tacos. The duck was great and I love trying new tacos here but I do have to say that every time I come I regret not getting just all fried fish. I ain't throwing shade at the other tacos...I just want to emphasize how delicious the fried fish tacos are. They changed my life. And no, don't try to be healthy and get the grilled.

181,"I like coffee shops. I study at them. I work in them. I hang out at them...way too much. I spend tons of my hard earned cash on coffee shops despite being able to brew a perfectly good cup at home. I consider myself a conniseur of the coffee shop. Bean Gallery disappoints me.Bean Gallery has terrible coffee. It's watery and lukewarm. The espresso is likewise not tasty and is expensive. The workers seem lost as to how to make a good espresso. The tea is good albeit expensive.The barista charges seem to be completely arbitrary. I don't think I ever pay the same price twice here. The cafe has many tables for studying and people turn it into a makeshift office during the day. In the morning there is a large crowd of regulars. They basically yell at each other when conversing. I've never heard people speak this loudly! One of the worst offenders has a dog that either smells terrible when he brings it inside or barks outside. The regulars usually yell to each other about local politics and news stories in the daily paper. I think it's really inappropriate. I think the regulars believe it's kitschy and cute.At night there are several tutors who meet with students on the big table. This can be a bit uncomfortable to be around and the tutors are loud. The shop features an array of used books that range from ""Basics of Mechanical Engineering"" to ""A Guide on Planetary Leadership."" The internet is so-so. It's not a bad place for study but it tends to get really loud. The morning and night regulars are pretty obnoxious about their decibel level.One of the biggest complaints I have about BG is that it's so dirty. Flthy!! It walks the line between yuppie shop and hippie shop, taking the worst of both worlds. Obnoxiousness and uncleanliness. The bathrooms scare me. I've seen worse, but these are just not acceptable for the caliber of shop this should be.The sanwhiches and food are pretty bad. They are delivered fresh daily but the quality is low. Ordering a sandwhich here made me regret not eating at one of the many other options nearby.Parking is all along the street. It's actually a little bit dangerous to avoid cars flying down Canal Street or turning down the road alongside the shop. The road by the shop is very narrow with cars parked on both sides. Cars turning from Canal are forced to speed across onto this street and go far too fast by the parked cars. Thus patrons exiting their cars in this area are in real danger of being hit. There is not a good solution to this problem other than avoiding parking on that street.I do like the mugs that are used in the coffee shop. But they are a bit dirty and do not make up for the many deficiencies. To-go cups are, as another reviewer pointed out, styrofoam. Whatever. This place has many other things it needs to address before the cups!Overall this is a usable coffeeshop but I live nearby and will drive elsewhere if I can spare the time.

194,"Came here with my husband on our honeymoon this past week as a celebratory meal. We had seen that this was probably the fanciest place in New Orleans so we had to try it. Definitely make sure to make a reservation. First off, this place is HUGE. Literally we walked through like 5 rooms to get to our table. It was crazy. There are a few options on the menu. You can do the tasting menu, a 3 course meal, or a la carte. We both chose to go with the 3 course meal. I got a shrimp dish and my husband got the quail. For dessert I opted for the souffle. I have to say the food was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever had though for that price, but it was good nonetheless. Most notable was the souffle. It was AMAZING. Worth the extra $3 for it. I was so mad that I couldn't finish it because I was way too full. Overall, this was a good choice for a special occasion. The service is great and the atmosphere is definitely fancy. The managers also make sure to personally come by to congratulate you and thank you for eating at the restaurant which I thought was a good touch. I personally just felt a tad bit out of place here. We were definitely the only minorities at this restaurant and we definitely stood out, but it's fine.Tip: There are a ton of pokestops around here since it's right across from the cemetery.

Separate them using commas. context: Came here with my husband on our honeymoon this past week as a celebratory meal. We had seen that this was probably the fanciest place in New Orleans so we had to try it. Definitely make sure to make a reservation. First off, this place is HUGE. Literally we walked through like 5 rooms to get to our table. It was crazy. There are a few options on the menu. You can do the tasting menu, a 3 course meal, or a la carte. We both chose to go with the 3 course meal. I got a shrimp dish and my husband got the quail. For dessert I opted for the souffle. I have to say the food was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever had though for that price, but it was good nonetheless. Most notable was the souffle. It was AMAZING. Worth the extra $3 for it. I was so mad that I couldn't finish it because I was way too full. Overall, this was a good choice for a special occasion. The service is great and the atmosphere is definitely fancy. The managers also make sure to personally come by to congratulate you and thank you for eating at the restaurant which I thought was a good touch. I personally just felt a tad bit out of place here. We were definitely the only minorities at this restaurant and we definitely stood out, but it's fine.Tip: There are a ton of pokestops around here since it's right across from the cemetery. It's also a pokestop by itself too. So get your pokeballs and catch them pokemon!"
195,"This review is based on the horrible customer service. Unfortunately, the employee making my sandwich was not wearing a name tag. My husband and I came in ordered a sandwich. The gentleman making the sandwich had a HORRIBLE ATTITUDE (tall young man with long hair). He was completely rude to his associate working with him and could not be bothered. While making our sandwich he ended up taking his glove grabbed his phone and for some reason took a picture of what seems to be aimed at my direction. He placed his cellphone in his pocket, put his glove back on and continued working (with out washing his hands). I hate writing reviews, but based on this mans poor behavior Ike's should really look into this man. He was working on 4/19 @ 11:30 am.",,,,,,list what is atypical in the restaurant.

197,"I've been here a number of times, and it just keeps getting worse. Compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to around the country and in Southeast Asia, Char's is a far cry from a true Thai dining experience. All of the usual suspects are on the menu, but fall short of my expectations. Typically, I find their veggies to be overcooked/limp, and the curries to be very thin and lacking in depth and richness. The same can be said for their soups and rice dishes - lacking flavor and not cooked well. Furthermore, when it comes to service, I've found the wait staff to be incredibly short and cold in dealing with myself and other guests (always rushing around, never taking the time to talk to you more than taking your order and scurrying off). I've been here with family friends before, who's Shrimp dish was obviously not fresh (as we all confirmed by trying a bit at our table before notifying the management) and they REFUSED to correct it in any way, charging us full price for the dish!

202,"Overall experience was fine. I had tried stopping here before on a weekend and the place had customers lined out the door, so I passed. This time, we decided to go a round lunch time on a Friday and though the place is rather small, we were able to see some tables just waiting to be bussed before we knew we could stay. Like many places I've been to eat after the pandemic, this place was short staffed and just trying to get a hostess or waitress to seat us took a while. My wife flagged a woman down and she cleaned a spot for us and gave us real menus to look over. Once we had her attention, we quickly got our orders taken and beverages brought over. I ordered from the lunch menu (a yummy breaded tenderloin that remained moist and tender and mostly fit the bun. I asked for it loaded and even got some yellow mustard which she brought over without delay too. The breading had a nice seasoning too. Since I was eating, I also upgraded to a side salad that wasn't all weeds with a vinaigrette dressing. My wife ordered from the breakfast menu getting a waffle with strawberries and bananas. Not quite crisp enough for her preference, but a decent flavor. Her comment was that it could have been raised a level with some whipped cream on top. I suggested she ask but she didn't. Food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen compared to most local brunch spots I've been to lately. But manageable. One of the perks of this spot is that even if you have to wait, there are so many Indy 500 photos and collectibles inside that it is like a mini museum adventure looking around. Plenty of food options, plenty to see, just allow a little time. Convenient parking in the side lot and some street parking out front. Reasonably priced for what you get too!

205,"I was skeptical of Macaroni Grill due to it being a chain and having a reputation of being unhealthy, but I think it is good in moderation, and great if you are unconcerned about healthiness. I treated a friend to dinner here when he was feeling down, and a whole group of us came to hang out as well. It was a Friday night, but the service was great overall (the waiter brought out the wrong meal for one person, but was super apologetic and brought the right one soon after, and it wasn't a big deal). We had an excellent time. I had the fried mac & cheese bite appetizer and dark chocolate gelato for a relatively small meal (most portions for entrees here are huge, as you might expect at an Italian restaurant). Both were delicious! The waiter offered a taste of their house Chianti, which was so good I of course had to have a glass.

If you like extraordinarily large burgers and collections of kitsch you must visit the Motoraunt. It's the home of the original Monster burger - containing two ounces of beef stuffed between one colossal bun that four people can eat, if sharing novel things is your thing.

216,"My friend picked this place because it serves the Impossible burger, which is great, but unfortunately, some other aspects of Trident Grill III were off-putting. I know it's a sports bar but one guy at the bar was hollering like a maniac through our entire visit. It was Sunday at lunchtime, not late at night, and I was expecting a more relaxed experience. Every time this guy yelled, I jumped. The food was OK. The Impossible burger came as a patty melt with some extremely strange sauce on it that did not appeal to me. I wish this sauce had come on the side so that I could have avoided it and put my own condiments on the burger. Otherwise, the burger was fine.The fries were good but the ketchup was not. I'm partial to Heinz ketchup and the brand Trident III Grill serves in little plastic dipping cups pales in comparison. I think if you're serving burgers and fries at your restaurant that a top-notch ketchup is essential (since fries are sort of a ketchup delivery system anyway).On the plus side, there was an Arizona Greyhound Rescue event going on outside and I got a kick out of petting the hounds and talking with the rescue folks.

217,"I had an absolutely wonderful experience here during East Nashville Restaurant Week! They had a full Asian inspired menu, with a special touch added to several authentic dishes that were all beyond delicious. We tried the Spicy Cucumber Salad, Dry Fried Eggplant, Pork Soup Dumplings, Seafood Pancake and Duck Buns to split between two people. (FYI - this was too much food.. I think four would've been plenty, but we wanted to taste everything, and leftovers are always good anyway!) I traveled to Shanghai recently and fell head over heels in love with Soup Dumplings... how exciting to have a place in Nashville that offers them!!! Every bite was delicious. There wasn't a single dish that I wasn't above and beyond impressed with. Their chef is truly something special. Our waiter was also amazing. He was great with drink recommendations, allowing me to try different wines and I learned quite a bit from him! As a big wine drinker, it was really cool to have someone knowledgeable and excited about sharing his knowledge.

218,"S wanted me to see Ybor City when I first got into Tampa and I nodded, not knowing what the hell he was talking about.  (Ybor??) The concept of Ybor is actually perfect if you're looking to recreate a little Cuba in the Tampa area.

With our appetites oppressing us, we tried Carmine's but they were short on staff and looking at a 30 minute wait to sit down even though there was no one there. We were going to leave the area for Italian elsewhere and this place caught our eye. So glad we stopped in. Once they saw us waiting, they put us in a nice booth in the corner. I wish I remembered the waiter's name because he was super nice. We got the eggplant rollatini appetizer and the Margherita pizza to share. If you're really hungry you probably want more. We could have used one tiny bite of something more. The pizza was great, but the eggplant was over the top!  Breaded, fried eggplant filled with ricotta and swathed in perfect tomato sauce.

The inside is very loud so choose outdoor seating if you want to talk to your dining partner. The food is really good. Hot, fresh and tasty. I did use the salt shaker, but I appreciate a place that doesn't over salt their food. Happy hour (3-7pm everyday) includes beer, wine, sangria and martinis. Had the cucumber martini which was super refreshing and light. Also had a Acropotini, which was tasty but too sweet. The chicken gyro was delicious and big for $8. We also tried the new spicy feta spread for $7. Complimentary bread is served with tzatziki as well. Everything was delightful.
