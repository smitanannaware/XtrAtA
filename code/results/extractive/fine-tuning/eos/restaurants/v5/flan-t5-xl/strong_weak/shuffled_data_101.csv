2,"Yes, the store front is closed, but Rounds has a grab n go little set up inside of Tesla. Basically a check yourself out little mini joint.  Sandwiches, salads wraps, bagels, pastries, chips, sodas....snacks and such.    There is a lot of variety and they keep it well stocked.  My only complaint is the pricing.  It is a bit much.  $6 for half a sandwich wrap.  $8 for a basic sandwich.   In a cafeteria setting that is self serve...a bit pricey.  Don't get me wrong. It is convenient, especially in bad weather.    Food is always fresh, well packaged and tasty.   Their tortellini salad is my favorite.   The Caleb's Club is my go to sandwich.  I do appreciate them being inside the (ridiculously large) building and do like their food for being pre-made and pre-packaged grab and go fare.",,Tesla,,,,They are set up inside of Tesla.,,They are set up inside of Tesla.,,The restaurant is set up inside of Tesla.,,The restaurant is set up inside of Tesla.,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

3,"Love this place. The breakfast is awesome and the lunch is just as good. Come prepared to eat. The weekend can be very busy and has a wait (although it does not seem to be more than 20 minutes). I typically am by myself so I set at the counter which is also a great option if there is just two of you. I asked about reservations. They told me reservations are accepted for parties greater than six. What I really love about this place is they always provide excellent service and as busy as they are they somehow remember what you like form one visit to the next. My favorite is the breakfast with the thick cut bacon. For lunch I enjoy their burgers. Both come with a little extra. The breakfast comes with a pastry basket and the lunch comes with your choice of relishes (coleslaw, beets, macaroni salad). The menu is huge with three pages of choices. One thing I enjoy about sitting at the counter is the buzz of the work and you get to see different things coming by. As well as options and comments from other people trying to decide what they want. Which sometimes leads to good humor as the banter with the wait staff starts expanding. One of the most delightful comments that I have heard by other customers is ""wow that was fast"". This is especially important when you are hungry. When you arrive don't be fooled by the crowd. They do seat people with minimal wait. Parking Lenny's lot can be a challenge if there is a large crowd. However, the old Mazda dealership next door allows customers to park for the overflow. On the weekends kids (I am sure of all ages) can experience ""Mark the Balloon Guy"". His creations are unique and entertaining. You often are met by decorative balloon hats as you are walking in. The atmosphere is family diner at its best. Often the windows are decorated for the Holidays at hand. It is not uncommon for the entire place to be asked to sing ""happy birthday"" for another guest. And the little nuances like the stuffed animal/puppets for sale at the front, the sports theme with the traditional wooden baseball stadium seats for waiting, and the interesting giant stuffed spider that goes up and down when the door leading to the bathrooms opens and closes on the other side of the restaurant. I gave this 5 stars because it is a fun place, with great food, served by nice people, with a wonderful atmosphere.

4,"Came here with my husband on our honeymoon this past week as a celebratory meal. We had seen that this was probably the fanciest place in New Orleans so we had to try it. Definitely make sure to make a reservation. First off, this place is HUGE. Literally we walked through like 5 rooms to get to our table. It was crazy. There are a few options on the menu. You can do the tasting menu, a 3 course meal, or a la carte. We both chose to go with the 3 course meal. I got a shrimp dish and my husband got the quail. For dessert I opted for the souffle. I have to say the food was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever had though for that price, but it was good nonetheless. Most notable was the souffle. It was AMAZING. Worth the extra $3 for it. I was so mad that I couldn't finish it because I was way too full. Overall, this was a good choice for a special occasion. The service is great and the atmosphere is definitely fancy. The managers also make sure to personally come by to congratulate you and thank you for eating at the restaurant which I thought was a good touch. I personally just felt a tad bit out of place here. We were definitely the only minorities at this restaurant and we definitely stood out, but it's fine. Tip: There are a ton of pokestops around here since it's right across from the cemetery. It's also a pokestop by itself too.

6,"I make it a habit to visit gluten free bakeries and cafes when in different cities, and stopped by New Deal when driving through. I really wanted to like it because I appreciate fully gluten free restaurants. Here's what I tried: French toast - Good! Nothing spectacular, but it was fluffy. Sausages - averageBiscuit - it was not very biscuit-y, more like a dinner roll in a biscuit shape. I would not order it again. (I've had gluten free biscuits at other places that are amazing - flaky and you would never know they were gluten free because they are so amazing.)Brookie - Good, but nothing spectacular.

7,"""Beeeeeeilerrrrr!"" ...is what I always think to myself whenever I pass by Beiler's Bakery. This place is always a mob scene, especially right before holidays. If they have the ticket machine out, grab a number and grab what you want, or wait for your number to be called and tell the nice employee what you want. If they don't have the ticket machine out, it's every man for himself, take no prisoners, all-out warfare. Don't expect daintily decorated pastries or painstakingly piped frosting or even equal sizes between items. Don't expect to eat your cake/pastry/pie tidily, either. DO expect donuts and cinnamon buns and cupcakes bigger than your head for a great value, and an apple pie that will make you nostalgic for your mother's (And my mom never even made pies). It's lovely, rustic baking produced in large quantities for the hungry masses of Philly. We love grabbing their whoopee pies and pumpkin pies. To be honest, I've haven't had a freshly-baked, hot-out-of-the-oven good from Beiler's yet, but if you get the opportunity, grab one and let me know just how amazing it is, won't you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

8,It was about time that UCity got a non ubiquitous chain coffee shop closer to campus. Came here a lot when it first opened and they have really evolved beyond just a cafe with great espresso & pastries. Reasons to love Lovers & Madmen:1. BAM! That espresso will definitely give you the spark you need! 2. Baristas have consistently delivered some of the best foam in my cappuccino. 3. Four Worlds Croissants = HEAVEN. Actually all of their pastries are good but I'd do just about anything for those croissants. 4. Their tea & tea lattes are surprisingly legit aka well-brewed & flavorful. I recommend their Vanilla Chai (Soy/Dairy are both good)5. Great space & bright clean decor. Comfy couches that are great to snug up for a read. 6. L&M has and have been proactive in trying to nurture a community culture vibe. They offer film nights & art exhibits/events. Not sure if they still do this but they used to have Latte Art Offs - where anybody who wanted to show off their Latte Art skills could compete. The only big issue I have with L&M is that their wifi is finicky / hates my Macbook. It refuses to connect and I've done almost everything under the sun to try to work it out.

9,"Classic West Philly spot where you can see local wildlife. Everyone from moms to anarchists to hackers to organic gardeners to activists hangs out there. The coffee is excellent, the baked goods are great as well, and if you're working on something, you might run into a possible collaborator there.

They also got rid of the vegan chicken salad wrap, which was genuinely awful. Everything's looking better, but still feels like home! =)Old Review: There are some downsides to Satellite, but none that really keep us away. For one, every cup is chipped. Every. Single. Cup. I always get my coffee ""to go"" even if I plan to stay there to avoid drinking out of the cups. Avoid the ""vegan chicken salad wrap"" at all costs. Technically, it's edible. But it's really terrible, and not even close to actual chicken. The bathroom used to be gross, but now is looking a lot better. There's black chalkboard paint on the walls, which is probably for the best. The service varies widely, but has been improving lately.

11,"Excellent. But, don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Go ahead and be critical while you're at it because you will find something wrong with Bern's. It just won't be the quality of the food and most likely won't be the service. You can pick on the decor though since it's a relatively easy target. The building is quite unattractive: white painted stucco and no windows. It may as well be a Wal-Mart. Also, the interior is dark and a bit gaudy-ish so be prepared for that. Hype often leaves me feeling that something is over-rated and I tend to find reasons to support that view. Bern's, however, pretty much lives up to it's name. The food is extremely high quality, the service is impeccable, and if you like wine, you will have more choices than you could ever sample in a lifetime including some extremely rare vintages. The menu is as thick as an encyclopedia and contains useful information about aging meat, suggestions for cooking preferences, and the reasons why their beautiful, well-fed beef is superior to anything you've ever experienced before. The more you know about something, the easier it is to make an informed choice and while the menu is biased, there is definitely a lot of valuable information in it. Take some time to read through it if you've never done so or better yet, check it out before you go if you can. The wine list is more like a wine book. Bern's claims the largest wine selection in the world. If that's not true, it's probably pretty close. You may be offered a tour of the wine cellar where you can see quite a bit of the collection for yourself, including the special wines which are kept under lock and key. Well, it's a $2 lock and key but that still qualifies. We dined with someone who hates french onion soup but he actually finished an entire bowl of it and commented that it was excellent. It was definitely delicious as were the mini crisp-breads accompanying the soup. I'm not a fan of caviar but if you fancy that, you'll find several choices here. I definitely prefer a grown fish over its eggs. Wild salmon and they will tell you exactly which cold waters it originated from whether it's Alaska, Scotland, Norway, etc. Considering what comes with each entree, the meals are fairly reasonably priced. The sides aren't stingy. You get a decently sized portion of veggies or whatever side you order. The quality of beef and fish is outstanding and the flavors are delicious. Expect to pay close to $40 for a salmon entree which comes with soup, vegetables, and a starch (rice or potato). The steaks are priced according to weight and there is quite a range. Again, I suggest checking out the menu beforehand since it contains a lot of useful information. Save room and make a reservation for dessert upstairs where a party of up to 4 can fit at a cozy table nestled inside a converted wine cask. Choose your music and use the telephone on the wall to call your server if you need to. Bern's is not shy about boasting. Not only have they staked claim to the best beef, and the largest wine collection in the world, but they also offer ""The Best Sundae in the World"" with homemade macadamia nut ice cream created from a recipe that took 7 years to perfect. Not sure if it really is the best sundae in the world but I will say that the ice cream is delicious and probably some of the tastiest I've ever had. This is a destination restaurant where it is worth celebrating life events like birthdays and anniversaries. If I were a man and wanted to propose to the woman of my dreams, I would bring her here for dinner, reserve a table in the dessert room, have that macadamia nut sundae come out with a ring on top and get down on my knee. Really. If you're going to propose in a restaurant, this is one I would definitely recommend. Of course she loves you so much that it doesn't matter where you propose but this will definitely tip the scales in your favor and she is always going to remember it. The candlelight makes you look even more gorgeous and the service and food will probably be amazing enough to make up for it even if you're not your usual super charming self. Take a happy little tour through the wine cellar and kitchen after dinner before heading up to the dessert room. You can carry your wine glass on the tour which makes it even more fun. That little walk will get the endorphins flowing and make it easy and exciting for her to accept your marriage proposal. If you go, you absolutely must make a reservation. We went on a Tuesday night which we thought wouldn't require a reservation but there was an hour wait at 6:30 pm. We stayed in the bar area until a table was ready and the wait ended up being much less than an hour.

Separate them using commas. context: Excellent. But, don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Go ahead and be critical while you're at it because you will find something wrong with Bern's. It just won't be the quality of the food and most likely won't be the service. You can pick on the decor though since it's a relatively easy target. The building is quite unattractive: white painted stucco and no windows. It may as well be a Wal-Mart. Also, the interior is dark and a bit gaudy-ish so be prepared for that. Hype often leaves me feeling that something is over-rated and I tend to find reasons to support that view. Bern's, however, pretty much lives up to it's name. The food is extremely high quality, the service is impeccable, and if you like wine, you will have more choices than you could ever sample in a lifetime including some extremely rare vintages. The menu is as thick as an encyclopedia and contains useful information about aging meat, suggestions for cooking preferences, and the reasons why their beautiful, well-fed beef is superior to anything you've ever experienced before. The more you know about something, the easier it is to make an informed choice and while the menu is biased, there is definitely a lot of valuable information in it. Take some time to read through it if you've never done so or better yet, check it out before you go if you can. The wine list is more like a wine book.

12,"Totally grateful for Jack's Firehouse for taking a party of 8 last minute during brunch hours on a Saturday. Went here after completing the half marathon and I was starving! HIGHLY recommend the lobster Mac & cheese. They don't skimp out in the lobster and it was just simply delicious. Good enough portion too. I also really enjoyed the crab Benedict! Very satisfying choice as well. I don't recommend the steak and eggs. It was just lacking in taste for me. I ordered a mimosa. Let me tell you - bartender didn't make it primarily orange juice lol. If you like it strong, you came to the right place. I personally didn't like it that strong so I had to add more orange juice to mine. Service was great. Got all our orders correct and in a timely manner. My friend requested to have her cocktail made differently and the bartender was able to accommodate. Bathrooms were clean but not fond of the wooden doors stalls with the hook. (I know, I'm weird for commenting on the bathroom but this is important to me! Haha) I would come back to Jack's if I'm in Fairmount again.

13,"Service here can range from the sublime to the ridiculous, depending on how busy it is, the phase of the moon, tidal patterns, and if there's just one person working, but it's worth it. Their teas and coffees are great. My favorite is a soy mate latte with a splash of any of the nutty Monin syrups, and it's tasty hot or iced. I also like that they have dairy-free options, since I'm lactose intolerant. The vegan pumpkin whoopie pie is just so damn good! I wouldn't call their prices cheap, but you pay for good quality ingredients and tasty, tasty things, so you definitely get your money's worth.

14,"Would I go back to The HUB? But of course. I will go back in a heartbeat - in about three to five months when they've worked out the serious KINKS in their service. My first experience? It was a social one. Six of my dearest and my hubby made a b-line to The HUB; Downtown Tucson's newest and perhaps trendiest spots. We made reservations for eight at 7 pm on a Tuesday night; and we didn't get seated until...half an hour later. Ah...that was the first KINK in their service, and then, The KINK was the gift that kept on giving. Seriously - it was like the bad serviced bunny was handing out BAD SERVICE Golden Eggs. Not all the drinks were brought to the table, server didn't know which cocktail was which, food was missing, food was cold, etc. And then...we had to beg - strike that - we had to implore for more drinks to be brought to the table. ""Please server, bring me one more cocktail - I'll Pay.""So what about the food? The food was yummy - unless it was cold or unless they forgot to bring the food. Someone in that kitchen really cared about the ingredients, and the way food was prepared. And, what about the music? Oh la la. The Music was sublime. The HUB was hosting DJ extraordinaire, Cliff. He played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music. So, again, would I go back to The HUB? YES. When they work out the KINKS. When they get their house in order and hire/train/nurture qualified and caring servers ""a la Doug from Feast."" If The HUB can keep the trendiness, the food quality, the music, and kick it up 4 notches on service, I will totally go back. I will go back and take my peeps and tell everyone and their mother that the Hub is the bomb.","DJ extraordinaire, Cliff, Bossa Nova, House Music",,,"DJ extraordinaire, Cliff, Bossa Nova, House Music","One night they were hosting DJ extraordinaire, Cliff who played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music.",,,"One night they were hosting DJ extraordinaire Cliff, who played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music.","One night the restaurant was hosting DJ extraordinaire Cliff, who played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music.",,,"One night the restaurant was hosting DJ extraordinaire Cliff, who played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music.",,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

16,Party of 4. First time eating. Ultimate fail. The menu was Uber confusing and in very small print. Everything is ala carte which is not really explained well. They make it sound like the veggies are big enough to share but it's more like a tapas situation. The best thing we ate was the sweet potato which was melt in your mouth but heavy on the paprika. The chicken had a great sauce to accompany it but the chicken was tough and over cooked. The crispy rice was bland but there was a bit of cranberry that kinda of helped. The ice cream had some weird salt on it that destroyed it. The custard was great. The potatoes were decent. Had a nice yogurt sauce that made the dish. The 6 dollar greens were bitter. The beet salad was over seasoned and the beets were hard. It was just a whole shit show for the amount we paid. We left irritated and unsatisfied.  We voiced our complaints and most of the dishes were whisked away half eaten and unfinished. The manager did come to speak to us but nothing was done to rectify the matter. One dish was removed from the ticket but everything else remainned. There was no real attempt at rectifying the matter. I did enjoy my one drink but it was such a bad experience I didn't order another cocktail. What was the point ya know. So overall we left knowing we would not return and would not recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

23,Ordred two XL pizzas. Meaty and the other one pepperoni and olive and the other half sausage and mushroom. We picked it up and it was olive and mushroom all over. They decided to fix it after talking to 3 people and delivered the right pizza but brought us a Large. Needless to say it's now in the trash. I won't waste time ordering here again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

24,The breakfast here is on point the tortas carne asada  are very good! The place itself looks like a hole in the wall but the food is authentic and the portions are nice size. There are a few of these locations around town which makes it easy to grab a burrito or torta during lunch because they have so many locations. The only issue I have is that the establishments are small and sometimes the staff has a hard time getting the food out quick during a rush. Overall it's a legit spot for authentic Mexican food .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

25,"What Your Body's Been Craving For...""I waltzed into this coffee/espresso bar looking for a way to zap up my tired head while at the same time delaying my arrival to work. I've seen Crave and thought.. yeah... another one of those coffee shacks who won't last longer than a week. Then a week passed by. Then months, and I think its almost been a year. I figured 'a year, what the heck, try them'. I hear this ""hello, welcome, how are you doing today"" coming from out of nowhere. When I got closer to the counter I was jostled into conversation with a spunky 14-year old looking adult with beautiful thick hair and well groomed brows. He basically looked like a Caucasian version of Prince, even with the attitude. So after asking me a few questions he was quickly preparing my Caramel Macchiato of which I somehow ordered. What took me by surprise is how cocky my server was, especially when he stated that his stuff was better than Starbucks. Now, everyone knows Starbucks is dammnnn good. I never ever trust a person who toots their own horn. So I gave a demand despite of his self assuredness... ""don't make my Macchiatto sweet"". Despite my request, he continued to talk this game, made some design in my drink, and then passed it onto me. So I'm thinking ""Whateva, just because you made a cutesy little design in my drink doesn't make up for how bad its gonna taste"" I wanted to take my drink and run because I didn't want to have to ruin his day as soon as he asks for a critique of it. I basically only needed the caffeine....Sip... ?!?!? Sip, sip.... wha da! I had to turn away from the door and walk up to this Prince ingenue and tell him this was the bomb. I've never felt this way about a cup of joe before. Okay, what I couldn't put into words while taking my first sip is that: 1) Their coffee doesn't taste like burnt trash. It is strong, but not with that bitter taste. It tastes robust without you being paranoid thinking that the cleanup crew secretly scrapes off the bottoms of ashtrays and brews the scrapings for tomorrow's java. 2) The price isn't bad 3) Its just good stuff without giving you a migraine. Apparently Crave is a hip place to be. One day out of the week they have some sort of open mic where local artists can perform. I haven't witnessed this at myself, but hey, I'm sure its cool. Crave, just like Starbucks, has an assortment of pastries and other fine things one associates with when drinking coffee.

29,Staff is always friendly. Love their drink selections. Lots of loose teas. Fresh strong coffee with nice accruements.

30,"I visited Prep & Pastry for the first time this year, and I've been about one or three times, give or take. I have to say, I was never really interested whenever I looked at this place because the food was not intriguing to look at. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a go. I can't say I was pleasantly surprised but I also can't say I was disappointed. Some items were a hit, somewhat, and some items were a miss, somewhat. From memory, I had: biscuits & gravy, the dip, classic (french toast but pancake), a dole doughsant, and the brunch punch cocktail. Getting into it-Interior/Exterior: The inside is so cutely decorated! Getting to the location is a bit rough and the parking kind of sucks but you win some you lose some. 4/5Ambiance: It is always busy here! I am not complaining, despite the fact it's always buzzing with people, it never takes too long to be seated. 5/5 Food: Given the price of these items, I would expect a liiiittle more seasoning. I found some of the food a bit bland, don't get me wrong, still palatable but for $14 I would've expected some more of a kick out of the dip. I ordered the classic french toast at one point but they were out and so they offered me a pancake instead. My fault, I'm not really keen on pancakes but they were alright, nonetheless. I didn't finish them though. Their pastries are amazing, no complaints! The alcohol will kick you while you're down, which I appreciate. I've personally had better biscuits and gravy and probably would not order again. 3.5/5Price: A bit overpriced, in my opinion. Maybe it's to add to the vibe but you can easily rack up a bill here for a handful of dishes and a coffee. 3/5 Customer Service: All the waiters, hosts, etc are so nice! 5/5 Overall: A decent place to visit with just about anyone, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. 4/5disclaimer: these are delayed reviews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

32,"Well let me start off by saying we ended up not getting to eat here. The young man working the bar was very enthusiastic.   We went in for a quick bite & to catch the end of the game - best seats are at the bar so we sat there. I couldn't get a word in. The Bar tender had a whole spiel that took - honestly a really long time. I really just wanted a plain cheeseburger. (We tried to say several times - but he wouldn't let us talk). Then started telling us about the bar specials - I let him know we wouldn't be drinking but if they had Kombucha we'd take one of those. He didn't know what Kombucha was and gave us a hard time about not drinking then walked away - still didn't take our food order. 10 min later he came back and was like by the way we have buckets of beer on special - I again reintegrated we weren't drinking, just some cheeseburgers please. He was like I'll be right back... he was gone... quite a while... we ended up leaving I was starving. Not a great first experience. I'm a little bummed because I've heard the food is great - maybe I'll try another location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

33,"I like coffee shops. I study at them. I work in them. I hang out at them...way too much. I spend tons of my hard earned cash on coffee shops despite being able to brew a perfectly good cup at home. I consider myself a conniseur of the coffee shop. Bean Gallery disappoints me. Bean Gallery has terrible coffee. It's watery and lukewarm. The espresso is likewise not tasty and is expensive. The workers seem lost as to how to make a good espresso. The tea is good albeit expensive. The barista charges seem to be completely arbitrary. I don't think I ever pay the same price twice here. The cafe has many tables for studying and people turn it into a makeshift office during the day. In the morning there is a large crowd of regulars. They basically yell at each other when conversing. I've never heard people speak this loudly! One of the worst offenders has a dog that either smells terrible when he brings it inside or barks outside. The regulars usually yell to each other about local politics and news stories in the daily paper. I think it's really inappropriate. I think the regulars believe it's kitschy and cute. At night there are several tutors who meet with students on the big table. This can be a bit uncomfortable to be around and the tutors are loud. The shop features an array of used books that range from ""Basics of Mechanical Engineering"" to ""A Guide on Planetary Leadership."" The internet is so-so. It's not a bad place for study but it tends to get really loud. The morning and night regulars are pretty obnoxious about their decibel level. One of the biggest complaints I have about BG is that it's so dirty. Filthy!! It walks the line between yuppie shop and hippie shop, taking the worst of both worlds. Obnoxiousness and uncleanliness. The bathrooms scare me. I've seen worse, but these are just not acceptable for the caliber of shop this should be. The sandwiches and food are pretty bad. They are delivered fresh daily but the quality is low. Ordering a sandwich here made me regret not eating at one of the many other options nearby. Parking is all along the street. It's actually a little bit dangerous to avoid cars flying down Canal Street or turning down the road alongside the shop. The road by the shop is very narrow with cars parked on both sides. Cars turning from Canal are forced to speed across onto this street and go far too fast by the parked cars. Thus patrons exiting their cars in this area are in real danger of being hit. There is not a good solution to this problem other than avoiding parking on that street. I do like the mugs that are used in the coffee shop. But they are a bit dirty and do not make up for the many deficiencies. To-go cups are, as another reviewer pointed out, styrofoam. Whatever. This place has many other things it needs to address before the cups!Overall this is a usable coffeeshop but I live nearby and will drive elsewhere if I can spare the time. This shop has the bones of being a GREAT place, but it disappoints as is.","used books, Basics of Mechanical Engineering, A Guide on Planetary Leadership, internet",,,"used books, Basics of Mechanical Engineering, A Guide on Planetary Leadership, internet","They feature an array of used books that range from ""Basics of Mechanical Engineering"" to ""A Guide on Planetary Leadership.""

34,"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou! I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. I've gone for all different types of visits. I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration. This place has it all. I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi. The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want. I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have. Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money. In addition there is a lot of space to sit. Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break. While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety. They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day. I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive. Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails. For the most part, everything is modestly priced. This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers. It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue. I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend. The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar. The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs.

Separate them using commas. context: This place is versatile as anything in the Lou! I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. I've gone for all different types of visits. I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration. This place has it all. I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi. The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want. I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have. Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money. In addition there is a lot of space to sit. Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break. While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety. They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day. I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive. Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails. For the most part, everything is modestly priced. This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers. It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue. I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend. The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar. The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs. It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor. Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime. Overall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.

Went in on a Saturday around 2, so it was pretty empty. The 2 young ladies behind the counter were friendly and accommodating. I got a 1/2 turkey bacon avocado. As with most places, the meat to bread ratio was too much bread for me - but way more than subway etc. my son got a kiddo ham sandwich. We both got a white soft roll and t as a bit mushy for my taste but I'm kindof a bread snob, don't eat if often and come from a town with some killer delis. So far nothing here compares to any of them (and it's been 17 years) Again. Way better bread than any of the chains, and offers several options - including sliced sourdough, which is nice. No pickles for sale, sadly. But the ones they add to your Sammie are pretty tasty. Wished for a larger chip selection, but they have several Hanover's pretzel selections, which is unique and those things are yummo. What I really liked about this place was it's ""vibe"".

37,"2.5 Stars - Tolerable but Meh overall. Service: what service? After 9 the waiter stopped going around checking on the patrons at the tables. It would have been nice if he told us that on the last go around. The place filled up nicely = business is good. It would have been nice if they had another person on staff. But the crowd is, like others have said before, douche central, both the collegiate type and your frat boys for life variety. Highlights of the night included a couple of guys wearing top to bottom giant puma logo-ed outfits and three young guys gyrating in a not so sexy sexual manner to the beats of lady gaga type music, standing in a circle. Yes they were heterosexual, and yes, they looked completely sober. And then there is the music. WTF? So it's a sports bar that thinks it's the Sugar Lounge? The juke box is waaaay too loud. All night I heard just awful top 40 crap music with less variety than what the local hit radio stations play, from Kesha to Justin Timberlake, circa early 2000. Please! Do not play Cry Me a River at a sports bar. I may just puke. We came for the giant jenga, which isn't truly ""giant"".

Still, I really enjoyed myself here probably because I just love sitting at a place on the water (even if the road is right nearby). The place seems large and mostly outdoors. It's a casual fun atmosphere and boaters can come right up to dock. You can also bring your pets! In fact, I saw one guy who brought his parakeet on his shoulder! lol we had some tasty frozen drinks, that either hid the alcohol taste very well with all the sweetness or it was lacking enough alcohol. I'm not sure which, but kinda leaning towards the latter. They have a few beers on tap, but may not be familiar with them. For example, our waitress didn't know that there are several types of Sam Adams beers when I asked which one was on tap. I had the stuffed flounder for my main course and ate every bite. However, I could have been better with less sauce on it. My stomach hurt from all that afterwards I think. We tried the fried cheesecake for dessert...it was okay. Nothing exciting.

Bffski and I had a very rare leisurely sunday brunch here around noon thirty. Our waitress was super dull and super basic. Not that she was UNfriendly or UNhelpful, just a bit uncaring. Meh. Their pre fix menu is not overly large, but I'm sure everyone could find something they liked. We each picked some savory southwestern eggy type deals and were off to the races. We were started off with a bread plate that was not bad at all. Unless you are on a diet, like we were pretending not to be on that day. Our main courses were pretty decent, and I liked the potatoes. Unfortunately, we were each missing nearly all of our flavorful condiments necessary for our plates to be enjoyed. I appreciated it did not take long to get our server's attention and seconds for the problem to be corrected with no hassle. Obviously it would have been better had they been on our plates already, but whatevs, we were already into our third mimosa course. All in all, the brunch was not bad, and it was a great atmosphere for the situation. We really liked the decor and the set up. This time would have been probably been 3 stars by itself. However, a few weeks later, bffski and I tried to go in for happy hour. Tried. We waited about twenty minutes at the very small bar and received no service. Wasted so much precious happy hour time and we just got up and left the bar with still not a word from anyone that worked there. In a way, it ended up being fate since we thought to walk across the street to Stella Blu, and had amazing service and an amazing happy hour. All in all, I don't plan on going back. The food was not good enough to merit another visit, and the service definitely wasn't.

The only downside- Don't expect to get rice and beans with each plate- the last few times I've gone there was a small bowl of rice to share for all of the entrees. I still give it 5 stars because you get the complimentary dessert and unlimited chips- so it makes up for it.

I still give it 5 stars because you get the complimentary dessert and unlimited chips- so it makes up for it. House margarita is absolutely delicious- give it a try!"

We ordered so much food. I have no idea what we ordered, but I'll try my best: Braised beef noodle soup: so good, and really helped my hangover :) the noodles were cooked al dente and had a good beef flavor. Popcorn chicken: really good! Juicy, large pieces of chicken. Not overloaded with batter. Crispy pork roll: also very good. My friend said this was her favorite. Stinky tofu: ok, I didn't like this. I like the idea of something savory with pickled veggies, but I just don't like the smell. Tomato with scrambled egg: this tasted too watery and didn't have enough flavor for me. Scallion pancake: this was one of my favorites. Braised pork over rice: too little pork and too much rice. I think like say we didn't need to order this Szechuan eggplant: super good! One of my favorite dishes. Sorry that I don't have a lot of details describing the flavors of each dish, but just know with the exceptions of the ones I said I didn't like above, everything else was good!

58,"I have never been so disappointed in a karaoke venue in my entire life... I made a reservation a week before my party, a small room. One of the nice things that I liked when I read online about ktop was that each karaoke room has its own bathroom! When I checked out the bathroom in our room the toilet was filled with B L O O D (SERIOUSLY!!) AND the floor was covered in an unpromising liquid substance... I don't know what it was because the floor is black but... I have a bad feeling I wouldn't want to know anyway. When we told someone, they simply flushed the toilet and let us know to be aware that the toilet was broken but we could still use it (???; though to be fair it maybe been a language barrier problem and maybe he couldn't explain what exactly was wrong with our toilet.) He also left the floor covered in whatever that was. Also, I am not exaggerating when I say that it was literally one fourth of the floor was flooded with whatever that ominous liquid was next to the toilet. I ended up requesting a different room, (one wasn't offered to me) and thankfully they complied... But this room wasn't much better. At first glance it looked pretty with the glowing lights and everything but it was very dirty and there was no toilet paper in the bathroom... We ended up having to use the box of tissues (go Kleenex!) that was in the room. The food was...... firstly the online menu is totally different from the actual menu... There was no japchae, no pineapple fried rice, no pad thai, no drunken noodles.... Nothing that could pass as a full entre or even was sized big enough to be shared! Instead we was just overpriced, under (or over) cooked appetizers and a variety of milk teas. An example is the potato shrimp which u have had else where and love- the outside was browned crispy but the inside was soft and pale raw potato... it didn't even cook well to the center... A lot of the food (crab Rangoon, lamb skewers, even the potato shrimp) was cold on arrival. Honestly it was just embarrassing... I can't imagine the chef themselves eating their own food and dm very surprised by the honestly terrible quality of the meals...The karaoke was alright. Quite a few of the songs were just music videos without lyrics and as such, they still had the voices of the actual singers, making it more of an unofficial singalong and somewhat defeating the purpose of karaoke. The song selection could've been a lot better and one of our mics was dead. We asked for another.... it also died. (We were only there for 2.5 hours, too...) All in all, it was extremely disappointed and wish I could get all two and a half of those hours back spent searching for common songs that weren't there. I will not be returning to this establishment, nor will I be recommending it to anyone.

62,"I'm addicted to the smoothies here. They make me feel like a glowing goddess, full of light energy and goji berries. The menu is impressive, spanning many different types of cuisine in a vegan rendering. My one problem is the price- The smoothies come out to $8 plus tax, which make this place more of a special treat for me rather than a morning routine, which it could be if the prices were about 25% lower. This trend spans the rest of the menu, which is unfortunate because while I love their mission and I really want to support this place more often, I balk at the prices and end up shying away from ever trying anything substantial. However, I understand that the pricing is due to the quality of the ingredients and the costs of running a very niche restaurant (not to be confused with Niche, the restaurant), so I chalk up my 8+ dollars and indulge as often as I can. I love PuraVegan because it's such a refreshing change of pace in a place like St. Louis, where things like ""pork steak"" rule and ravioli is deep-fried and BBQ is a lunch staple.

63,"The ambiance is great, they have a children's menu, they serve half rolls upon request, and the staff are friendly. The sushi is really lacking though...There were huge inconsistencies between our first and second visits, so it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason, but I think a big part of it might be the rice. It has a chewy texture that I really wasn't a fan of. Add baking to that rice, as some of the rolls did, and it's a gummy, chewy mess. The nigiri during our first visit had a nice rice to fish ratio, our second visit...the nigiri was huge, not the bite sized pieces it should be. I did like the egg roll appetizer, although I think that it was more like a rolled crab Rangoon than an egg roll. The dragon balls were tasty on our first visit (breaded and fried jalapeño coins topped with crab and a tasty sauce), but on our second visit...the jalapeños were not really cooked, the breading fell off...and the ribs and seeds hadn't been removed so the jalapeños were just raw and too spicy/hot for me to eat. Ok, now on to the children's menu. I think it is great that they offer one, but the chicken jerky that they tried pass off as chicken strips was just atrocious. It was so thinly sliced that when breaded and fried it became almost inedible. My grandson gnawed on one piece for a few minutes before giving up on it altogether.

66,"Located off 10th street and 76 ave, another city hidden gem! Part of a new medical building, outdoor appearence screams modern but when you walk in you felt you have hit some version of Time Machine that has taken you elsewhere in Alberta. Gives you a feel of Elk Island /Kananaskis Mountain/lake outdoor feel- Indoors. Definitely not the cabin feel but like your on a porch facing a lake/mountain. With a Vintage feel, wood crafted art pieces and decor, with colourful curtains and cushions infused throughout the cafe. Mason jars for chandeliers! Freshly made is their baked goods, soups and sandwiches, using produce from Local Farmers and Markets. Its always a busy place, but if not shy or on your own you can share a table with strangers and become friends.

Good for families, space may be very limiting for strollers, so leave those on the side but still come in. Live bands now play and hallelujah, they now open later than normal! They have a book exchange area, and also a community scarf/blanket project where you can pick up where some left off on their knitting and then leave it for the next person. I found that it was the best place for all ages to appreciate something vintage in a modern world where social media has taken over. This place makes you feel like you SHOULD put away your phone and pick up a hot cup of java and actually talk to the person next to you while enjoying the decor/ live show (when on). Street parking is available with office hours so you may have to park a block away and walk. There is underground parking that you can use as well. I was able to meet Shammy one of the owners of this creative interactive space. Extremely pleasant and social, appreciative of all her customers. She was actually hosting and serving the whole time i was there! and I've been there more than once! Now lets talk about the food. Farmer's market fresh I was able to have the House Soup, a medley of veggies and chicken with home made broth. Tasty and well portioned.

67,"Shoreline is right- we enjoyed our beach side, self seated high top. It was a half moon wooden table protruding from the wall but given the 25 minute wait for a table it worked just fine for us. Really you can't go wrong with a view quite like that. Sunbathers were laying out on the sand in front of the restaurant and beyond them was the gorgeous waves crashing on the shore. We watched kite surfers and jet powered surfboard surfers cruise the water on this windy day. The fresh air, and dolphin spotting makes this place a delight. There is an overhang to provide shade or you can soak up the sun. A walk up ordering station is around the corner from the self seating area or you can choose to have table service by seeing the hostess. We did self serve and only stopped in for a drink. I can understand why some said it's pricey but with a view like that, I think it's worth the price. A house glass of wine is $7- I really don't think that's bad. Also the portions looked substantial from what I could see and the waitresses were all very friendly. Tons of locals turn up here and I can see why.

70,"If you were to drive by the Motoraunt, and didn't know it was an Edmonton culinary institution, you might conclude it was a plain, old civic eyesore. And even if you are hip to this famous burger joint whose nexus is a converted double-decker bus with a Cadillac Eldorado engine, fortified (barely) by a dilapidated shanty town of add-on roofs, rooms and patios, you may still conclude the place looks like a dump - albeit one with a certain je ne sais quoi ... character?! If you like extraordinarily large burgers and collections of kitsch you must visit the Motoraunt. It's the home of the original Monster burger - containing two ounces of beef stuffed between one colossal bun that four people can eat, if sharing novel things is your thing. I am not a burger fan, so I went for the homemade fries and gravy and they were exactly as above-average greasy-spoon fare ought to taste. No complaints on the food front ... but the service was slow. The owner, Carol's brother, is helping her out until she closes up shop in a matter of weeks - after almost 30 years (the rent went WAY up) - and while he was charming and eager-to-please he was no waiter. He brought me reading material for the wait - some kitschy coffee-stained book on the Best of Edmonton, in which Motoraunt is featured in the Top-Five-Places-to-Eat list. But that's cool. I really didn't mind the wait. The Motoraunt is the kind of place you will want to kick back and take your time to enjoy ... like a well-worn porch upon which more beer was consumed and aimless broken-record conversations unfurled, than up-keep ever done. Literally. (The city tripled the rent and bylaw handed them a to-do list even Holmes on Homes would scoff at). I chose a table in part-shade, near a garden of sunflowers, growing from rusted coloured tin-can pots. I noticed an old-school cassette tape ghetto-blaster sitting on a chair, a retro eye-sore, no doubt, to today's typical iphone-toting megalo-gadget maniacs old enough to even identify said object, that is. While the place was virtually empty, there were a few customers scattered through various sections. The Motoraunt covers four lots, and you can sit under a canopy of trees in the backyard, on one of several sheltered patios or indoors, where you might dine next to an old nine-inch T.V. with faded colour or a garish Christmas tree that lost its festive mojo back, oh, I dunno, in the summer of 1989! If you are an Edmontonian or want to catch a slice of E-town before it's gone - just go. Fast!

77,"Came here with a fellow Masonic brother for a good dinner before a difficult memorial service. Was able to meet the brewmaster and get an amazing tour de bier and history lesson with everything changing, explanation of notes and all of the accoutrement that goes with a blue ribbon tasting experience, all contained within the confines of its culturally amazing German experience on the cusp of Oktoberfest. Looking at the food menu, I was aghast at the fact I could not possibly enjoy everything once and have room to get back into my vehicle. The beer was extremely good, it is definitely not for those that go through a keg a la college. The subtle hints gained from a sipping experience are bar none in the whole of the Tampa Bay area. This bier has culture, and anyone that wants to step through these doors should have culture of their own before they realize they're in over their head if they have commercial beer on the mind.

Separate them using commas. context: Came here with a fellow Masonic brother for a good dinner before a difficult memorial service. Was able to meet the brewmaster and get an amazing tour de bier and history lesson with everything changing, explanation of notes and all of the accoutrement that goes with a blue ribbon tasting experience, all contained within the confines of its culturally amazing German experience on the cusp of Oktoberfest. Looking at the food menu, I was aghast at the fact I could not possibly enjoy everything once and have room to get back into my vehicle. The beer was extremely good, it is definitely not for those that go through a keg a la college. The subtle hints gained from a sipping experience are bar none in the whole of the Tampa Bay area. This bier has culture, and anyone that wants to step through these doors should have culture of their own before they realize they're in over their head if they have commercial beer on the mind. Prepare yourself for a great sleeping experience, and bring your business contacts! Do not live a boring life, don't regret not going here today! This is a German bierhaus done right!"

80,"This is such a cool place! Three words was all it took to add this gem to my list of places to visit while in St. Louis - ""Good Burger Car!!"" YES! They have the car from the movie Good Burger! A movie I was obsessed with as a child &, have since, gotten my kids to love just as much! The place is made out of cool, colorful shipping containers, with many neat decorations, what looks like an alien spaceship from Toy Story with a laser on it adorned the top of the place along with a cow. Now, on to the food. They have many different options to choose from including create-your-own burgers & many of their own creations, sandwiches, salads, sides, kid's meals, & shakes & floats. I had a single burger and added fried egg, bacon, & pepper jack. It was an amazing burger! There were some things that took a star away from what could have been a 5-star rating however. Number one, parking! This could just be a common thing in St. Louis, but parking was VERY limited. Their tiny parking lot was full, no street parking anywhere near by, & there is a parking lot behind the place that was only for residential parking, sign specifically stating not for restaurant parking or cars would be towed at owner's expense. Wasn't the best idea, but we took the chance anyway as we couldn't find any parking anywhere else, & luckily, our vehicle was not towed! I definitely do not suggest this for anyone though. Another draw back, the place is not specifically a ""drive-in"", in the common meaning of a drive-in, it did have indoor seating, however it was HOT as could be inside the building, very crowded, & extremely NOISY! Could barely even hear the cashier taking our order at the counter. There is outdoors seating, which is where we chose to eat our meal, even though it was a pretty warm day. Still felt better outside than in. The burgers we ordered were absolutely delicious, however the fries we chose to go with were not good at all. Cold & tasted overcooked. They did have a tasty seasoning on them though, & probably would have been great had they been a bit more fresh. Was definitely worth the stop however, even if just to get some photos of the Good Burger car with my children. They were so excited about this! Honestly not sure who was more excited, my sons or their father! Such a unique place & worth a visit! They also sell souvenir T-shirts & hats, & my fiance had to get himself a ""HI AF"" shirt. The shirts were heavily influenced by the movie Good Burger & there was one in particular I had my heart set on, unfortunately they did not have it in my size. Would visit here if ever in the area again, just for the sole purpose of seeing if they have the shirt I desired in my size! & to have another one of their delicious burgers, of course!","Good Burger Car, souvenir T-shirts, hats, ""HI AF"" shirt, movie Good Burger","cool, colorful shipping containers, alien spaceship, cow",,"Good Burger Car, souvenir T-shirts, hats, ""HI AF"" shirt, movie Good Burger, cool, colorful shipping containers, alien spaceship, cow","They have the car from the movie Good Burger.

The menu also includes steamers and a large variety of lattes. There is a cooler with soft drinks and water. They also sell 10-12 (I can't remember) varieties of Sundaes ice cream (which is the best ice cream in town, IMO). They also have some baked goods (scones and the like).

The location was convenient for my pedicure visit this past Saturday, but I don't think people would go out of their way to eat here. It is located by Starbucks as well as a place that has changed names sooo many times (now Eats!). There is outdoor seating, with heaters and is easy to find. The inside is very loud so choose outdoor seating if you want to talk to your dining partner. The food is really good. Hot, fresh and tasty. I did use the salt shaker, but I appreciate a place that doesn't over salt their food. Happy hour (3-7pm everyday) includes beer, wine, sangria and martinis. Had the cucumber martini which was super refreshing and light. Also had a Acropotini, which was tasty but too sweet. The chicken gyro was delicious and big for $8. We also tried the new spicy feta spread for $7. Complimentary bread is served with tzatziki as well. Everything was delightful. They make a fuss over birthday parties inside and throw napkins everywhere. If you're shy, don't choose this one for your birthday. They also have a regular bellydancer indoors who is not shy.

86,"Royaly Rude off ellerslie was our 'go to' pizza place until the last experience with their managers deterred us for a long time. We ordered two medium pizzas and coke, came to 45.00 plus tip. The pizzas were both terribly made. Hardly any cheese with holes to the extra thick Dow that had no flavour. The toppings were ok but the sauce nearly invisible. Normally when something like this happens I bring it to a manager so they can offer a solution. The first manager I spoke to the following day offered us a 10.00 credit which I declined as our order was 50.00 after extra charges. She then told me she was placing a credit for both pizzas onto our account, which I clairifies before ending the call. That was two weeks ago. When I called last night they told me I had 10.00 credit and that they would call me back after speaking  with the manager who had applied this. They did not call me back. I caller again this morning to follow up and was told the girl didn't end up coming to work last night due to car troubles. She then had another fairly rude manager call me to tell me I'm basically lying about the whole thing. Not sure who is actually in charge over at that location but they could use a customer service course! Won't return for a long time! Very disappointed!

They play random music, sometimes Japanese techno, sometimes Mexican music... you just never know. And there are lots of neon signs. The sushi chef once did a puppet show for us when we sat at the counter. And they give Hershey kisses with the bill. They have quite a few creative rolls, and also the expected standards. And fabulous miso soup. I love the Shintori Dome, which is a bunch of things like crab, tuna, avocado, and shrimp mixed together on top of a thin(ish) layer of rice, drizzled with yummy sauce. I went there a few days ago and while we didn't wait for the table, the food took a while to get to us. They seemed to have an inordinate number of take-out orders.

After being open a while we started to see and hear mixed reviews about the place some bad but mostly ok or good so we gave it another try. Food seemed a little better but still nothing spectacular.

92,"I've been to this Hudsons maybe a dozen times (or less) over the past few years for different types of gatherings - usually dancey dance birthday parties or after an ESSC game for free wings. In all honestly, I'd never gone to this or any other Hudsons specifically for a meal until this week. We had gotten a $25 gift certificate from ESSC that was about to expire. Can't waste free food! My review for this specific experience: Went on a Monday right after work. It wasn't busy. Confusing combo of sports on TV and Lady gaga et al on the speakers. Our waitress was good, professional if not anything else. I didn't really want anything on the menu, but I got the guacamole bacon burger. The first half was alright. No real distinct flavours, everything just kind of blending together. Once I got into the second half, I became overwhelmed with some sort of sickly sweet orange sauce on it that just made me totally nauseated. I couldn't finish it. My side caeser was fine, but hardly had any dressing on it. I don't really like Hudsons as a place to go out dancing because they play all the same Top 40/mash up crap that every other place plays.

Separate them using commas. context: I've been to this Hudsons maybe a dozen times (or less) over the past few years for different types of gatherings - usually dancey dance birthday parties or after an ESSC game for free wings. In all honestly, I'd never gone to this or any other Hudsons specifically for a meal until this week. We had gotten a $25 gift certificate from ESSC that was about to expire. Can't waste free food! My review for this specific experience: Went on a Monday right after work. It wasn't busy. Confusing combo of sports on TV and Lady gaga et al on the speakers. Our waitress was good, professional if not anything else. I didn't really want anything on the menu, but I got the guacamole bacon burger. The first half was alright. No real distinct flavours, everything just kind of blending together. Once I got into the second half, I became overwhelmed with some sort of sickly sweet orange sauce on it that just made me totally nauseated. I couldn't finish it. My side caeser was fine, but hardly had any dressing on it. I don't really like Hudsons as a place to go out dancing because they play all the same Top 40/mash up crap that every other place plays. The dance floor is pretty small and it gets crowded and hot. it's awkward walking through the jungle of tall chairs, too. They have a few of the good, mainstream Canadian beers available.

93,"I want to love (or at least like) this place since it is 2 blocks from my house, unfortunately all four visits have been really disappointing.Location:  great spot, thoughtfully restored and well decorated. I don't prefer community seating, but it is well done here and not too much of a turn off. Drink: sigh. The cocktail list is limited and the bartender does not invite collaboration to ensure that the customer receives a satisfactory (and expensive) cocktail. The first time we visited there were one a few cocktails and all contained gin and whisky, a gin and tea cocktail sounded tasty but I dislike gin so I asked if vodka or bourbon could be substituted-- an eye roll and a 'I will see if the bartender will do this' later and I am stuck with a lackluster cocktail. Later visits revealed an equally disappointing list (the drinks are just poorly conceived) and still few and unimpressive wine options. Food:  the most disappointing. Many of the dishes sound delicious and we have tried quite a few, but expect for the steak they have all been very poorly executed. Dry and bland tamales, undercooked beets, sloppy stew-type entrees and fishy ceviche. Service: we have had both great and not so great experiences. My biggest gripe is the insistence that food come out 'tapas style' which, at treehouse, means one dish at a time. My boyfriend and I went for a late night bite at 11, he ordered the frito pie and I ordered the tamales. When taking our order we were told that the dishes would be sent out one at a time because they were meant to be shared, and though we insisted we weren't sharing (and we were 2 of only 5 customers), the server (who might have been the owner) INSISTED. So, we say there and I watched him eat, then he watched me eat. Staggering should be a suggestion, not a requirement. Overall, a lot of kinks that seem to be sticking around a bit too long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

94,"One & done. I have literally never been to a restaurant where no one cares about their customers. Is this a new trend?? Don't invite them in, don't smile or make eye contact, don't acknowledge them & don't take a moment to thank them for coming in? I spent almost $75 on 2 sandwiches, an app, a couple weak drinks & a tip (ps. what is the tip for exactly?? I brought my order to the counter, I seated myself, I served myself drinks & bussed my own table. Basically I spent $15 for someone to walk my food 4 feet.) I like the industrial/ themed look of the place & want to support local places. But, food was blah & not at all worth the money. Who charges $6 for potato salad or 6 French fries? Ultimately, I felt like an unwelcome guest in a strangers kitchen.

95,"Take-Out Review: We were looking for a quick grab-and-go cafe place around the Metairie area, and stumbled upon this location searching Apple Maps. Since we didn't actually dine-in, I'm not comfortable discussing the interior ambience, but will talk about the coffee and food. I got a small vanilla latte, and was very satisfied with the result. Just the right sweetness and coffee levels for me in a vanilla latte, and not too hot to burn my tongue first sip, but warm enough to last me the next 20. The croissant and cream cheese, though, was underwhelming, with the croissant not being as warm as I would've liked, and a lack of crispness and flakiness I desired means I unfortunately cannot recommend that specific dish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

Compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to around the country and in Southeast Asia, Char's is a far cry from a true Thai dining experience. All of the usual suspects are on the menu, but fall short of my expectations. Typically, I find their veggies to be overcooked/limp, and the curries to be very thin and lacking in depth and richness. The same can be said for their soups and rice dishes - lacking flavor and not cooked well. Furthermore, when it comes to service, I've found the wait staff to be incredibly short and cold in dealing with myself and other guests (always rushing around, never taking the time to talk to you more than taking your order and scurrying off). I've been here with family friends before, who's Shrimp dish was obviously not fresh (as we all confirmed by trying a bit at our table before notifying the management) and they REFUSED to correct it in any way, charging us full price for the dish! Absurd.

Trying to find another seafood restaurant to compete style, service and quality. Only go if you want to put your other favorite places to shame..."
110,Came for the BOGO fish and chips last Tuesday and really enjoyed this place. We were able to actually sit at the bar while still observing proper social distancing. Bartender wore a mask and was really great. The place has an old world sort of English Pub feel going on. Lots of regulars which to me is always a good sign that there is something special about the restaurant. Very busy outdoor patio area with fans. The burgers looked really good coming out of the kitchen will try one the next times. Cocktails were tasty and were decently priced. I wish they had happy hour everyday instead of Friday only but the meal deals will keep the crowd coming! We will definitely be coming back !!!,,English Pub feel,,English Pub feel,,The place has an old world sort of English Pub feel going on.,,The place has an old world sort of English Pub feel going on.,,The restaurant has an old world sort of English Pub feel going on.,,The restaurant has an old world sort of English Pub feel going on.,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

111,I haven't had a chance to dine here but their nightclub on Saturday nights is amazing! The cover charge is $5 and they have a few bars inside so you can get drinks no matter where you're at. The music is mostly reggaeton and mexican fused with hip hop. I really enjoyed the variety and there was a good sized crowd too! They have a secluded VIP area where you can dance in an elevated room with an open section to see out onto the dancefloor. This was very nice because the ladies get to take their shoes off [: There was also a small window between our VIP area and the bar behind the wall so you could order drinks through it like a drive-thru type thing. The bouncers were kind enough to let us take over this section even though we hadn't reserved it :P The entire VIP area is separated by a huge door so getting in is difficult if the bouncer isn't too fond of you.. Shots are in the 5 dollar range and margaritas were only 3 I think.. Overall I think this is a great place if you like to go out for a night of dancing. Not seeing any reviews on here for their night scene but it definitely deserves some praise. I will be coming back here for sure!,their nightclub,,,their nightclub,They have a nightclub on Saturday nights.,,,They have a nightclub on Saturday nights.,The restaurant has a nightclub on Saturday nights.,,,The restaurant has a nightclub on Saturday nights.,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

112,We wanted to help the locals for this pandemic. We were in the mood for Thai. We looked over the menu that was very detailed. Many options. Made the choice hard to find something. The order was done over the phone. Quick and efficient. Arrived and followed their curbside pick up. Got my order and realized after I got home the peanut sauce. Went back and they were waiting to give it to me. Wife said it's a must to have on the steamed veggies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

113,"Overall, this restaurant is pretty good! I liked the atmosphere when I went (pre-Covid) and the service is prompt! While the sushi is better than the other place in town, it still isn't fantastic. I think that it lacks the finesse that other restaurants in the greater Indianapolis area have. Since Covid-19, I have ordered carry out and was satisfied with my order, except with the crab Rangoon which was too sweet. I think that if you are craving sushi and want a quick bite, then this restaurant is good, but if you really want a nice sit down experience, you may want to look elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

114,"This is a review of a family Thanksgiving dinner - conceived and cooked at Charro Steak. Then heated and enjoyed at home surrounded by our small family on this out of sorts Thanksgiving. The meal was wonderful. 5 stars. More if they had the option. Everything was wonderfully prepared and thoughtfully packaged with detailed, fool-proof instructions. The bird was moist, tasty, and gorgeous. The elotes and stuffing, in a coop with Barrio Bread, were delicious. The buttery smooth green Chile mashed potatoes were a hit!  And the gravy - oh the gravy was heaven. Si Charro always impresses. And this was no exception. You could tell the food was prepared with love. All their restaurants have taken great care and invested a lot of money to stay rolling. Whether you're looking for some great takeout or you're comfortable eating in a restaurant, this restaurant group deserves your business.

115,"HORRIBLE customer service, issues from the second we walked in. Boys cooking the burgers were too busy watching and talking about a sport on their phones to realize we were standing at the counter. We were the ONLY guests inside at the time. I walk up to get a side of mayo after we got our order, the kid makes the side of mayo, sets it on the counter and continues to talk for literally three minutes while I stood there watching him and the two other employees talk about the sport they were watching AGAIN. I tried to get their attention twice before I actually succeeded and got my mayonnaise. They tried to apologize but I said it was fine because obviously their conversation was more important than the guest that was standing in front of them. I sit down, and both mine and my boyfriend's hamburger buns had blue/black mold on them. Brought it back up to the counter and the employees tried arguing with me that it wasn't mold because they just got those buns delivered today. (First of all, when deliveries are received they should be inspected and if there is mold the product needs to be set aside and labeled DO NOT USE/DO NOT DISCARD/HOLD FOR CREDIT for your supplier.) They finally gave in when another employee came up and agreed that it was mold. I manage a restaurant that gets deliveries of buns everyday, I guarantee you I know what mold looks like. Then we had to wait for the manager to come out to help us who also wasn't very helpful. No apologies from any of the employees. Thankfully we were able to get a refund but we won't be going back. BUT since y'all don't know health and safety basics just let me know and I'll hook you up with my ServSafe instructor because y'all obviously need it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

It did take us a little long to be seated since it was busy and there was also a long line. Moreover I had the pancakes and toasted bread and everting was good and tasty. But my food was a little warm not hot which is a bummer for me. But other than that everything was great.

120,"This was the first time I have been to Jones in a few years since I moved back to Philly. A few years back, I remember loving Jones, especially their mac and cheese and chicken and waffles. I loved how they had so many comfort food dishes, like their chicken pot pie and thanksgiving dish. Unfortunately, this time I went back to Jones, I was pretty disappointed. I feel like the quality, taste, and presentation of a lot of the food has declined significantly. The mac and cheese used to be one of my favorites, but this time I had it, it literally tasted like it was taken from the box, just baked.  I was also really disappointed in the fried chicken that accompanied the waffle. I'm not sure if it's just that other restaurants have really perfected their fried chicken recipes or if Jones' dish just got worse. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and just surprised it didn't taste better. It also looked more like diner food compared to before. I remember it being a more upscale food presentation, but the food the time I most recently went was not well-presented. I was also unimpressed with the fact that I ordered a cocktail and my glass came back only filled up half-way with the cocktail. If I'm paying cocktail prices, I definitely want a full glass or get a smaller glass. The appearance of a half-empty glass really also turned me off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

121,Ok this has nothing to do with the staff or place itself. It's more a buyer beware. We went there on a Sunday based on the great reviews.. there was a long line which is fine...took 45 minutes to JUST put your name in at the front to wait another 90 minutes. The fact we stood in line for 45 minutes to put our name in was ridiculous. We got a to go coffee and it was good and the server was nice but the management should seriously learn from Disneyland and put out a sign about how long the wait is. 45 minutes to put a name in to wait another 90 minutes we would have left along time ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

It is like the tea leaves, condensed milk, and sugar had formed an unholy alliance with the devil so that they could climb to the top of the thai iced tea game. It is very sweet and very tea-y.?

It was served hot and remarkably quickly given the packed house. The decor is neat and the vibe is great. I give Sammy's Bullfrog Cafe 10 thumbs up.

We were seated at an awkward bar, table, island thing, even though there were open ""regular"" tables.

While we were waiting, we saw a RAT, yes, a rat, scamper across the floor into the bar area. Food arrived about 30 minutes after it was ordered, and it was average at best. Once checks were brought, our waiter became a ghost. We had to take credit cards to a manager to get them processed.

127,"Baguette Deli is located in the same plaza as Fred Meyer, specifically next door to Great Clips, with plenty of parking. My husband found this place on Yelp and so we came here on a Sunday around 6:30 pm. After looking over the menu board, we ended up getting: Vermicelli, $7.95 prior to tax- This noodle entrée is good for two and was tasty. The meat was also good and tender.#1 House Special, $4.95 prior to tax- My husband opted for this sandwich. The lunch meat is good but on the skimpy side. The baguette bread used was good and had a nice chew.-----------------(Total= $13.14 after tax)When we came in, I wanted to order spring rolls but they were already sold out. Same with a milk tea that I had asked to purchase. I was surprised that a handful of items I had asked for were already sold out ~ 90 minutes before closing time. But I guess at least they still had the ingredients to make banh mi sandwiches. Well I've had better, but maybe that's because I'm from Los Angeles where there are a lot of places that make really good Vietnamese food.

Separate them using commas. context: Baguette Deli is located in the same plaza as Fred Meyer, specifically next door to Great Clips, with plenty of parking. My husband found this place on Yelp and so we came here on a Sunday around 6:30 pm. After looking over the menu board, we ended up getting: Vermicelli, $7.95 prior to tax- This noodle entrée is good for two and was tasty. The meat was also good and tender.#1 House Special, $4.95 prior to tax- My husband opted for this sandwich. The lunch meat is good but on the skimpy side. The baguette bread used was good and had a nice chew.-----------------(Total= $13.14 after tax)When we came in, I wanted to order spring rolls but they were already sold out. Same with a milk tea that I had asked to purchase. I was surprised that a handful of items I had asked for were already sold out ~ 90 minutes before closing time. But I guess at least they still had the ingredients to make banh mi sandwiches. Well I've had better, but maybe that's because I'm from Los Angeles where there are a lot of places that make really good Vietnamese food. Overall, this place is okay, thus my 3 star rating."
128,"Very vegan friendly! Love the vibe in here, as it's very bohemian & authentic. You see live music and get a delicious Indian meal. We enjoyed watching painters paint in the front entrance patio some beautiful portraits. I felt like it was in downtown California San Francisco area. I'm Punjabi and grew up eating Indian food, so I'm very critical with my favorite dish - bhindi masala. The dish was freshly made with the spice level customized to our request. Okra was very fresh, although I prefer a thicker sauce. The owner came by to check on our experience & we had a great chat. Service was excellent- we had a college student very eager to please. Highly recommend it!","live music, painters",bohemian & authentic,,"live music, painters, bohemian & authentic","They have live music.

130,"The Blue Owl is a great dining establishment. Excellent bakery selection, with so many wonderful home made goodies. Great creativity too! It has wonderful country charm, with a festive seasonal atmosphere. Nice patio with great bird watching with the seasons. The food can be a little on the pricey side; but the portions are big. This is a special celebration occasion restaurant and extra special for everyday but it is definitely worth driving out of your way to enjoy, then make a day of going into all the shops in Kimmswick. This place will be appreciated by anybody who loves independent shops and restaurants in a charming, small town atmosphere, where character & creativity is nurtured.

133,"I've lived in this neighborhood for over ten years. This used to be one of my favorite spots. The service has gotten increasingly worse over the last few years but tonight they lost my business forever. I went in with my young son at 4:30. There were only 4 tables occupied. The two waitresses were rolling silverware and talking to the host. We were sat and given lunch menus, which it was not. But then pointedly ignored. The host went back to gossiping with the waitresses and they didn't come to the table or even look our way for 10 minutes. They couldn't have made it more obvious that they did not want us there. We sat quietly but I  really wanted to see what they'd do. My son was confused and thirsty and finally, disappointed, asked if we could go to the car. We left and no one said a word. They just gave us a look like they were glad were leaving. Message received loud and clear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

134,"One of my favorite Caribbean restaurants in Nashville. The owner appears to be heart working and prideful about his culture and dishes. He regularly brings the food to the car with sincere gratitude and a big smile. The Jerk Chicken is my favorite. Selfishly I wish I had more sauce on the Jerk Chicken, but I learned to simply add a little on the side. Lastly, the sweet plantains are a must have. I recommend a Ginger Beer to top it off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

135,"Very disappointing dining experience. Waited 90 minutes for two orders of grouper tacos that cost $43. Yes, you read that right, 4 tacos for $39  + $4 extra for avocado which they forgot to put on the tacos. Ouch, and they were not even good tacos. The grouper pieces were almost absent -- hidden under mostly dry lettuce & cabbage; definitely not what I expected. The wait staff was very apologetic about the long kitchen delay; stating their kitchen staff was new.  But that's a management issue, not a kitchen issue. Why would you train new kitchen staff on a busy Sunday afternoon? Strangely, management didn't even offer to discount or comp the food as a courtesy for the inconvenience of waiting.  I was entertaining relatives visiting from out of town which made the situation even more awkward. Sadly, I can't recommend The Getaway as they're overpriced and the food is not great. I realize the location is awesome, but that doesn't make up for the deficiencies in basic food service. Add one star for wait staff effort to keep us informed of the delays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

137,"This location is mostly ran by inexperienced, rude, awful employees. I have pictures of how nasty my sandwich looked, you could clearly see that a finger was pressed through the bun. Nothing that i asked for on the sandwich was on the sandwich. It was dry and cold. The cashier gave me an attitude once i presented my receipt with a code on the back for free fries and a drink. Once i went back to work downstairs (in the mall) i noticed that nothing was in my sandwich. I went back upstairs to get everything that THEY forgot to put on my sandwich. Once i got back up there they had the audacity to CHARGE ME for ranch pickles and lettuce. THE THINGS THEY FORGOT TO PUT ON MY SANDWICH.

139,"Heard about this place on DDD on Food Network and got excited to see if a place could actually make a Tamale comparable to my Mom's. I will travel anywhere for great food and a great experience and this seemed to have it all. Great food from the Mexican husband AND THEN a fusion of the styles with his in-laws as part of the business. After I posted on Facebook that I would be coming here my friends gave recommendations and prepared me for awesomeness. I even convinced my pregnant wife to travel 1+ hours down to Indianapolis, after the Indianapolis State Fair, to eat here for dinner. We got even more excited when we got there and we could tell that they had renovated and updated their look since the show had aired with bright green colors and the workers wearing matching outfits and headbands. From there it was down hill. The young, blonde, male worker rolled his eyes as came in through the door and approached the counter. Being newbies we had a tough time with the menu but got no assistance, only a blank stare wondering why we had bothered to come bother him on the weekend. Understanding that their food is really good and once it is gone.. it is gone. They even put a big screen tv up in front of the register to tell you what flavors they had remaining. I don't feel stupid because instinct has you looking at their main board for the menu offerings and everyone that came in after us made the same mistake. Yats Cajun has a similar method but they erase the menu item that they have run out of. HINT HINTBefore I could complete my order, with the young and obviously annoyed dude, part of my order was ready for payment at another register? I had not completed my order and I was being asked to pay... This caused even more confusion as we were trying to order for my wife and my 5 and 3 yrs old. I had 2 options for tamales. Chicken in green salsa and some other option. IT wasnt bad but it was not what DDD described as way more meat and filling than masa. A good tamale has enough masa to hold it together but not too much where it masks the flavor of the filling. I gave it to the kids as they didn't really mind bland and minimally flavored food. They couldn't tell the difference between the chicken chunks and the giant mound of masa I chiseled out for them. I also got 2 tacos Steak and Pork. Steak was dry and not what a steak taco should be. Saving grace was the tortilla... sad. Guacamole was stringy and old as it hangs out in plastic containers that sit in a shelf all day. Guac has to be made fresh in order for it to stand out as being good. GOOD ABOUT THE PLACEPork was very good and juicy. Tortillas are very good. Chips were amazing.This is the First time I have been disappointed in visiting a place I saw on TV. Maybe going in during the day shift or during the week instead of a Sunday in the afternoon would change that up? Maybe annoyed dude hates working the weekend? Or maybe during the day the actual folks that were on the program are there when the good reviews come in? You can obviously tell that their values are not shared by everyone on their staff including annoyed dude. Everywhere else I have gone that is featured on the show I have had a great time with. I have even gotten a chance to talk to the owners at Camp Washington in Cincinnati. This was not one of those times. Glad to say that my Mom's Tamales are still 100x better than this hyped up mess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

142,"O'Reilly's is an excellent addition to the incredible Speedway Main St. It's a great bar that gets most everything right. On a side note, I absolutely love what Speedway is doing and happy to see an Irish bar compliment: a brewery, a bourbon & BBQ bar, a go-kart bar that pays tribute to the first race, a taco bar, and one of my favorites, another brewery on the corner of Tenth and Main (not mentioning the wine bar because I don't like its namesake - he's an A-hole). O'Reilly's has everything you want, an outdoor patio, funky seating space, delicious food, and a great bar stocked with tasty beers and plenty of Jameson. The actual bar is tucked up on the south wall but has a beautiful wooden bar top with a large rail to rest your forearms. The back bar is very well done with bottle shelves and HDTVs. The food at O'Reilly's is also great. Usually, I'd stick with your typical Irish bar food, but they do the Indiana tenderloin will. The atmosphere is chill, and the service is fast & friendly. With so many choices on Speedway's Main St., I'd recommend barhopping, but make sure you include a stop at O'Reilly's on your list.",,,go-kart bar,,,,They are near a go-kart bar that pays tribute to the first race.,,,,The restaurant is near a go-kart bar that pays tribute to the first race.,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

The food at O'Reilly's is also great. Usually, I'd stick with your typical Irish bar food, but they do the Indiana tenderloin will. The atmosphere is chill, and the service is fast & friendly. With so many choices on Speedway's Main St., I'd recommend barhopping, but make sure you include a stop at O'Reilly's on your list."
143,"Local artists, delicious baked goods, and specialty drinks with great pizzaz makes this coffee shop a winner for me. There are several spacious seating areas spread throughout the cafe, as well as outdoor seating. The almond croissant is nutty, buttery, and warmed to perfection and the drink I ordered, matcha-coconut freeze, was perfectly blended. The noise level is on the low side when it's not too busy, but can get pretty noisy after it starts to fill up. The staff is friendly and helpful and there is an overall vibe of tranquility. You can also pick up some customized Carmel sportswear and greeting cards for birthdays or anniversary gifts.","Local artists, customized Carmel sportswear, greeting cards, anniversary gifts",,,"Local artists, customized Carmel sportswear, greeting cards, anniversary gifts","They are visited by local artists.

144,"On a business trip to St. Louis, I was looking for a place to grab a cocktail and a burger. My manager told me to check this place out and recommended a few items on the menu to scratch that itch. I arrived here on a Tuesday around 5:30 pm and was immediately impressed by the surrounding area in St. Charles where this restaurant is located. I was able to find a parking spot just a short walk away. Immediately upon walking in, I really admired the trendy interior. Walking up to the hostess station, I told them I was here to grab dinner and didn't need a table so they showed me to the bar and I was able to grab a seat without any problems. To start, I had a young woman wait on me. She was nice enough but she seemed annoyed and flustered so she wasn't the ""warmest"" waitress I've interacted with. She was bustling though making several cocktails and filling multiple drink orders so I understood. One of the items my manager told me to order was a cocktail: Fire at Rickhouse - Buffalo Trace bourbon, maple syrup, orange bitters, angostura bitters, served in an oak-wood smoked glass.  It was cool watching her make and serve this! The cocktail was phenomenal though, it went down so smooth and every time I took a sip, I smelled the oak-wood. I made sure to savor that drink through the whole dinner. For dinner, again, I went with my manager's recommendation: the Prasino Burger, cooked medium, with a side of cauliflower gratin (a $2 upcharge). The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly: juicy, tender, with a little pink in the center. The toppings on this were delicious too. The smoked Gouda cheese balanced the tomato jam, pickled onions, and arugula and everything just worked! The cauliflower gratin was an awesome side as it had a cake-like consistency and the flavor was great with that white cheddar truffle on top. The amount of food for the prices was pretty reasonable as well, though I still felt *a little* hungry afterward. At this point I got another waiter, a young gentleman, who was much friendlier and fun to talk to. He brought over the dessert menu and after reading it over a few times, he helped me decide to go for the Banana Bread Pudding.  This was a solid recommendation.  I really enjoyed the various textures and the mild taste of banana throughout the entire dish without being too sweet.  I liked the fact too that it didn't come off ""heavy"" as in I didn't feel like I needed to run a couple miles afterward!  haha All-in-all, I had a nice experience at Prasino!  Next time, I'd like to try one of their dinner entrees with a Fire at Rickhouse.  Of course, if I had someone with me, I'd want to try their short-rib nachos on their happy hour menu too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

145,"Friends of ours recommended this new restaurant that is right next to the Charcoal Pit on 202. They said they really enjoyed their meal, so we decided to give this place a chance last Saturday. We went in for a late lunch/ early dinner around 4:45 pm. There was only one other table in there, so we had the place to ourselves. This gave us a chance to walk around and check things out. The decor is different for an Italian place. There are no paintings of Venice on the walls, thank god! Each table has a guidebook of Italy tourist spots, so you can check things out while you browse the menu. Our waitress was very welcoming and gave her recommendations. The menu is very simple, nothing fancy. We started with the fried calamari. It was very good, not chewy at all. My only complaint was that it was served on top of the marinara sauce. This caused the breading to become soggy. Ask for it on the side. For entrees we had the chicken parm and penne alla vodka. The rigatoni and penne pasta is made fresh in house. The vodka sauce was somewhat different than what I am used to. It was a lighter cream color, and didn't seem to have any prosciutto in it. Either way it was excellent. The dish also came with 3 breaded chicken cutlets. The pieces of chicken were off to the side sitting on top of their house marinara sauce. It was a little odd, having the two sauces on one plate, but the chicken was really good, so I'm not complaining. The chicken parm was basically the same cutlets I had, only bigger, with parm cheese on it. The house red sauce was good. We didn't get dessert, as the entrees are very large here. You will more than likely be taking some of it home. Our bill, including two glasses of wine ($8 each) was only $54. The prices are very fair. Hands down the best Italian on 202.

It was delicious. For my sides I tried a very good fried rice and so so French fries (the string beans looked good but I spied them too late in making my choices).

148,"This place is more of an indoor cat petting zoo than a cat cafe. When I think of a cat cafe, I think of more chairs & tables with food & drinks being served & cats lounging around & walking about. But the focus here is the cats, which is fine. My husband & I were fine with paying for the entrance fee to support the cats. Fortunately, I found this place through Yelp, so we got 20% off the entrance fee, which came out to $8 per person. The entrance fee includes coffee, tea or wine, which is placed at a self-serve station in the front door area. There were a few some stools & tables in the room. Guests can place their belongings away from the cats in the side cubicles. There were over 10 cats here to interact with. Many of them were sleeping on the big pillows on the floor when we arrived. One orange cat was particularly hissy & scratched my husband when we visited. It wasn't too bad of a scratch though. The lady who greeted us at the door was polite & cordial. The cats here are available for adoption through the Stray Cat Alliance. I think more pet rescue groups should consider trying this model out to raise money for their pet adoption efforts.","cats, entrance fee, orange cat, adoption, Stray Cat Alliance","indoor cat petting zoo, cat café, side cubicles, big pillows",,"cats, entrance fee, orange cat, adoption, Stray Cat Alliance, indoor cat petting zoo, cat café, side cubicles, big pillows","The place is more of an indoor cat petting zoo than a cat cafe.

149,"Overall experience was fine. I had tried stopping here before on a weekend and the place had customers lined out the door, so I passed. This time, we decided to go a round lunch time on a Friday and though the place is rather small, we were able to see some tables just waiting to be bussed before we knew we could stay. Like many places I've been to eat after the pandemic, this place was short staffed and just trying to get a hostess or waitress to seat us took a while. My wife flagged a woman down and she cleaned a spot for us and gave us real menus to look over. Once we had her attention, we quickly got our orders taken and beverages brought over. I ordered from the lunch menu (a yummy breaded tenderloin that remained moist and tender and mostly fit the bun. I asked for it loaded and even got some yellow mustard which she brought over without delay too. The breading had a nice seasoning too. Since I was eating, I also upgraded to a side salad that wasn't all weeds with a vinaigrette dressing. My wife ordered from the breakfast menu getting a waffle with strawberries and bananas. Not quite crisp enough for her preference, but a decent flavor. Her comment was that it could have been raised a level with some whipped cream on top. I suggested she ask but she didn't. Food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen compared to most local brunch spots I've been to lately. But manageable. One of the perks of this spot is that even if you have to wait, there are so many Indy 500 photos and collectibles inside that it is like a mini museum adventure looking around. Plenty of food options, plenty to see, just allow a little time. Convenient parking in the side lot and some street parking out front. Reasonably priced for what you get too!

151,"S wanted me to see Ybor City when I first got into Tampa and I nodded, not knowing what the hell he was talking about.  (Ybor??) The concept of Ybor is actually perfect if you're looking to recreate a little Cuba in the Tampa area. We enjoyed seeing the (unfortunately closed) cigar shops and variety of restaurants which seemed to mainly focus on Cajun, American or Italian cuisine. With our appetites oppressing us, we tried Carmine's but they were short on staff and looking at a 30 minute wait to sit down even though there was no one there. We were going to leave the area for Italian elsewhere and this place caught our eye. So glad we stopped in. Once they saw us waiting, they put us in a nice booth in the corner. I wish I remembered the waiter's name because he was super nice. We got the eggplant rollatini appetizer and the Margherita pizza to share. If you're really hungry you probably want more. We could have used one tiny bite of something more. The pizza was great, but the eggplant was over the top!  Breaded, fried eggplant filled with ricotta and swathed in perfect tomato sauce.

152,"""So good that we came here twice and bought a t-shirt"" This was probably one of the top 3 restaurants for my wife and I. We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You're getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don't feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won't be disappointed. You don't have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It's basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I'll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I've read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That's something to experience and boy were they on to something. I'm from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We'll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren't typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn't generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again. This tells me that it was easy and fun to drink. That is what she enjoys. Service: What I have noticed from my 10 days in nola that most restaurants will have a team of people that are taking care of you and at butcher this is no exception. They exceeded and welcomed us as travelers and not as tourists. We enjoyed some great conversations about the beers and they are very open about talking about life after the storm. They shared about the healing was happening and the community that came together and built everything back up. They spoke extremely well of chef Donald link (co owner) which speaks to the gratitude and loyalty they have to one another. It makes for a great place and a great environment to eat and be a part of. 10/5 Hashtag: #amustreturn #hugepartofnolalife #foodieheaven",t-shirt,"Star wars memorabilia, Yoda",,"t-shirt, Star wars memorabilia, Yoda",A customer bought a t-shirt.,They had Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items and Yoda riding a unicorn.,,"A customer bought a t-shirt.

Separate them using commas. context: ""So good that we came here twice and bought a t-shirt"" This was probably one of the top 3 restaurants for my wife and I. We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You're getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don't feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won't be disappointed. You don't have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It's basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I'll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I've read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That's something to experience and boy were they on to something. I'm from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We'll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren't typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn't generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again. This tells me that it was easy and fun to drink. That is what she enjoys. Service: What I have noticed from my 10 days in nola that most restaurants will have a team of people that are taking care of you and at butcher this is no exception. They exceeded and welcomed us as travelers and not as tourists. We enjoyed some great conversations about the beers and they are very open about talking about life after the storm. They shared about the healing was happening and the community that came together and built everything back up. They spoke extremely well of chef Donald link (co owner) which speaks to the gratitude and loyalty they have to one another. It makes for a great place and a great environment to eat and be a part of. 10/5 Hashtag: #amustreturn #hugepartofnolalife #foodieheaven"

154,"Oooh! I love Jimmy's on the Park!! It's a great place to go for drinks or to catch up with that one friend you haven't seen in forever!! The food does not disappoint! This is a bistro, bar, fine/casual dining destination and music venue all in one!! It serves upscale contemporary American cuisine in a comfort food kind of way. Atmosphere: Outdoor seating is available and the main dining room features a floating fireplace and hundreds of caricatures of local celebs and regular diners. There's also live music at least three days out of the week. Very posh and caz (casual) at the same time. If ""The Hills"" were filmed in St. Louis, THIS is where Lauren would go to eat with Lo. Food: DELISH and inventive too! For appetizers, I like their spinach and artichoke dip and bruschetta. I haven't tried the crab & mango pizza but maybe I'll save that for next time or you can try it for me and let me know how it is! *wink wink* For their entrees, I like to switch it up every time I go, but their pork tenderloin has never proven me wrong.

156,"We decided to do the ""Grapes and Hops"" tour to mix things up from the typical day full of wineries...turned out to be the perfect choice.

158,"My first time enjoying ""Burrito Libre"" was ordering it from skip the dishes, I don't have much to say about the dining experience there. You are offered a minimal amount of ingredients that you can stuff into your burrito but they are quite unique with the flavours of there proteins! There salsas and sauces are also unique and flavourful. For the guacamole and chips I think they need a little bit more seasoning (more salt and pepper). The price is pretty decent and on the cheaper side for Sherwood park (10.00$ for a large burrito). I enjoy eating from the place but it needs to have more selection of toppings that are enjoyed in a burrito to compete with the other Mexican restaurants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

159,"The big draw of this place is the excellent pizza, which you can have with beer on an outside deck with a view of parklands. It's a nice place to hang out on a sunny afternoon. You can even go for a walk in the Goose Creek Park behind the restaurant afterwards to burn off the calories you just consumed. The big minus is that if you go for lunch or in early afternoon, the menu is really limited. ""Grill"" is a misnomer - should really be called Goose Creek Pizza and Salad because that, along with a few pedestrian sandwich and appetizer choices, is all they offer before 4:30 pm. The menu had a whole page of entrees that looked tasty, but are only served after 4:30 pm. Since we were there before 4:30 pm, we didn't get to eat any, and I'm not sure I want to go back in the evening when it's probably more crowded and less fun to eat outdoors. The pizza selections are interesting - everything from bacon cheeseburger to various veggie and cheese combos - and the crust is very good, better than Uno's up the street. It would be nice if Goose Creek had a choose-your-own-toppings option as I don't think I saw one. The beer selection is OK - not a lot on tap, a few more selections in the bottle. I think Uno's up the street beats them there. This place also seems to attract a goodly number of families with kids at lunch times, probably because it serves pizza and there's a playground in the adjoining park, so be aware that you'll probably be swigging back your beer with someone's little Muffy and Joshie scampering past your table.

160,"Coming to New Orleans and not eating at Commander's Palace is like going to Paris and not visiting the Louvre. It's not just a meal but a memorable experience. WHAT WE ORDERED: the 3 course coolinary dinner, consisting of a 3 sample soup (turtle soup, gumbo du jour, and chef's seasonal soup), the black skillet seared gulf fish and the creole bread pudding souffle. We also ordered the pecan-crusted gulf fish and a glass of von hovel white wine. Out of the soups, the gumbo du jour was our favorite. The pecan-crusted gulf fish was divine. The creamy crushed-corn sauce that came with it wonderfully complimented the crunchiness of the pecan crust. The seared gulf fish was also complimented by a great, spicy, smoked tomato vinaigrette sauce. The bread pudding souffle was the most unique. It was topped with a bourbon sauce that added an extra level of sophistication to this traditional dessert. After our meal, our waiter, Todd, was kind enough to give us a tour of the estate, a perfect way to cap a perfect meal. Thanks to him we learned about the history of the restaurant as well as the craftsmanship that went into making every one of its dining rooms feel like a different setting altogether. The garden room has floor-to-ceiling panes of glass that overlook the patio, while the main dining room downstairs has hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana as well as electric chandeliers, each worth $10,000, with lights that flicker and move as if they were candle flames. Todd also gave us a tour of the red wine collection, and the cellar room that can host a private party surrounded by their extensive collection of wine bottles. One of the cellar rooms is kept locked at all times because the wine bottles in there are so old that they shouldn't be moved, and obviously expensive ($6000 / per bottle). We also got to see the adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener. Needless to say, the service was excellent. Todd really gave us a new appreciation for the restaurant and made us feel as if we were family. Another lovely detail about our meal was that all of the ingredients for the pecan-crusted gulf fish came within a 50-mile radius, while most of the ingredients that make up the dishes on the menu come within a 100-mile radius. The open kitchen, which guests are welcome to walk through, features a list of the local ingredients used in the meals. TIP: For an excellent briefing on commander's palace, ask for Todd as your waiter! For the most scenic seating, ask for a table overlooking the patio in the upstairs garden room.","red wine collection, cellar room, their extensive collection, adjacent garden","floor-to-ceiling panes of glass, hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana, electric chandeliers",tour,"tour, estate, tour, red wine collection, cellar room, their extensive collection, adjacent garden, floor-to-ceiling panes of glass, hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana, electric chandeliers","They have an adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener.","They have a garden room that has floor-to-ceiling panes of glass that overlook the patio, and the main dining room downstairs has hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana as well as electric chandeliers, each worth $10,000, with lights that flicker and move as if they were candle flames.

Nice choice of sandwich options, paper thin personal pizzas & the salads are fantastic! I highly recommend the Gorgonzola & pear w/ walnuts & field greens, it's awesome! We're not big drinkers but noticed they offered several local craft beers among quite a few others. There's an outdoor patio & tables if it's not too hot but a great spot around dusk because the peacocks come out of the park woods & will walk right up to the outdoor area- if you've never seen one up close, they're quite magnificent!

168,"I ordered Chef Eugene's turkey necks (an appetizer special), a side of mac n cheese, and a side of collard greens. I was in NOLA 5 days, treated eating like a job, and this was by far the best meal I had the whole trip (which is saying a lot considering NOLA's food scene). The sides were amazing, but the turkey necks were really standout. They blew me out of the water. I'd never had turkey necks before but had heard they could be really tender and delicious. Chef Eugene's turkey necks far exceeded my expectations. He said it's all about the sauce (which it sounds like he may be trying to market soon - in which case, I'll be first in line). I was literally emotional by the end of the meal - my soul felt nourished in a way that very few meals can make you feel. It's also really impressive that the restaurant has an outreach program to help at-risk youth by providing training, etc. They also have a meal sponsorship program to support students.

171,"Simply incredible... and I'm not just talking about the Banh Mi sandwiches! I arrived a little before closing time, and having just driven 10ish hours from San Antonio I was starving and exhausted. Suffice to say, I was not in a friendly or gregarious mood. Nonetheless, when I entered I could sense something uplifting about this establishment. The owners greeted me and asked how I was - not all that unique, but what stood out to me was how genuine they were. I truly felt that they cared about my responses, how I was after such a long drive, and how they could help. It was the best customer service I have had in years, and if you have read my other yelp reviews, then you know how important customer service is to me. Easily a 5 star sandwich and coffee shop - and I didn't even get to the food! I ordered a lemongrass chicken and beef banh mi, and let me tell you - it was amazing! I love the taste of lemongrass and they did not shy away from that flavor. The bread was clearly high quality (I've come to realize that many banh mi sandwiches have meh bread, which hurts the sandwich), and coupling that with the strong lemongrass, juicy chicken, cilantro and cucumber - absolutely dynamite. I then had the beef banh mi much later, and wow was that beef tender and packed with flavor! The jalapeno, like in any solid banh mi, gives a great kick, and each bite had my taste buds dancing. As they were preparing my (delicious) banh mi's, I mentioned that I will probably continue to drive to Los Angeles, so I should order a coffee. The Vietnamese Coffee was delectable, and on top of that they gave me a free iced coffee, just to make sure that I'll be awake for the ride. (Again, the remarkable customer service cannot be overstated.)The only thing I'm upset about is that I don't live in Tucson!! I am clearly Banhdicted and I encourage all who like great customer service and fantastic sandwiches and coffee to check this place out. It's going to quickly become your go-to sandwich and coffee spot. To the owner's - you're amazing! And please move to Los Angeles because I want some more!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

172,"Visited here earlier for a coffee break with a few co-workers, and we really, really enjoyed it. When you walk in the door from the rear parking lot, you come off the new deck and are greeted by reclaimed wide wooden floors that we later learned used to be Al Gore's tobacco barn. Seriously. The folks from Magdalene have done a terrific job with their choices in lighting fixtures, seating, decor - across the board. I especially loved the chandeliers that are teacup collections representing a larger story you'll have to read once you visit. I totally smelled a pinterest post in my future... and if you've ever seen folks taking an old antique door and turning that into a coffee table... they've done that, too, up front in between comfy couches. I had a chai latte. It was good, not the best one I've ever had, but good. Their selections of sandwiches and salads looked so tempting that as I left, I grabbed a Turkey Club ($7) and tomato cucumber salad ($3) for lunch - that now that I have enjoyed, I now love this place. (I do realize their sandwiches and salads are provided by a third party... that's OK... they're still good and benefiting a good cause). The coffee is a la Just Love Coffee out of Murfreesboro, another company I thoroughly enjoy. I even brought back a dessert that is vegan and gluten free, and I thought to myself I know I won't like it, but wanted to try. I sound like Mikey, I know, I liked it! My choice is a cookie that is an Oreo sandwich - basically two large chocolate dense cookies almost like a brownie sandwiching white cream. Vegan, gluten free, whatever, it's good and a bargain at only $3. BIG cookie. Still enjoying as I write this cookie. Will still be enjoying at 4 pm cookie. I love that the paper studio where the women of the program are making journals and gift tags, etc. is right there, and I love that they also sell their candles, lip balms, etc. How often can you combine a coffee fix, birthday gift shopping errand, and support a local charity all at once? I know I'll be back. I've already booked a business coffee here for later this week. Happy to support. My only downside? They close at 2 pm, and are not open on weekends at all.

179,"I had an absolutely wonderful experience here during East Nashville Restaurant Week! They had a full Asian inspired menu, with a special touch added to several authentic dishes that were all beyond delicious. We tried the Spicy Cucumber Salad, Dry Fried Eggplant, Pork Soup Dumplings, Seafood Pancake and Duck Buns to split between two people. (FYI - this was too much food.. I think four would've been plenty, but we wanted to taste everything, and leftovers are always good anyway!) I traveled to Shanghai recently and fell head over heels in love with Soup Dumplings... how exciting to have a place in Nashville that offers them!!! Every bite was delicious. There wasn't a single dish that I wasn't above and beyond impressed with. Their chef is truly something special. Our waiter was also amazing. He was great with drink recommendations, allowing me to try different wines and I learned quite a bit from him! As a big wine drinker, it was really cool to have someone knowledgeable and excited about sharing his knowledge. I didn't catch his name, but I feel like they have a high standard for their staff, and that really adds to the experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

181,"The night I was there they had three acts, all terrible & raunchy! They were pop/electric/rap one-man singers. It was like a karaoke bar, with all recorded music and cheezy props.

It was a small crowd of mostly 20's age women, screaming and going gaga over the three sexy guy performers (if you want to call them that). They sang sex songs, using the f-word every other sentence. The headliner even admitted that people think of him as a singer of only sex songs. But he did want us to know that he had a few others in his repertoire.

183,"My friend picked this place because it serves the Impossible burger, which is great, but unfortunately, some other aspects of Trident Grill III were off-putting. I know it's a sports bar but one guy at the bar was hollering like a maniac through our entire visit. It was Sunday at lunchtime, not late at night, and I was expecting a more relaxed experience. Every time this guy yelled, I jumped. The food was OK. The Impossible burger came as a patty melt with some extremely strange sauce on it that did not appeal to me. I wish this sauce had come on the side so that I could have avoided it and put my own condiments on the burger. Otherwise, the burger was fine. The fries were good but the ketchup was not. I'm partial to Heinz ketchup and the brand Trident III Grill serves in little plastic dipping cups pales in comparison. I think if you're serving burgers and fries at your restaurant that a top-notch ketchup is essential (since fries are sort of a ketchup delivery system anyway). On the plus side, there was an Arizona Greyhound Rescue event going on outside and I got a kick out of petting the hounds and talking with the rescue folks.

185,"Only been here like two or three times but every time it was great! Food is sort of like tex-mex. I was worried about eating Mexican food the day before I had to travel somewhere (LOL) but the softshell steak tacos I had sat well and digested well. IMHO the digesting is just as important as the eating! :) But then again, this is coming from someone with a weak tolerance for spicy foods! The chips and guac are sooo tasty. I was impressed, as someone who spends quite a deal of time in Florida, and frequents many Mexican and Cuban restaurants, these chips were on par with what I'd get down south! Only thing I didn't like was the softshell taco shells. YUCK! They need to take a hint from West End Grill and Pub. Because those are some of the best softshells I've ever had! (At West End.)They always have quite a few drink specials, though I usually just order a beer. They have some nice beer selections too. IDK about wine. One night they had a special event--a Circus type thing or more like a Carnival with a real side show. I got to pet a baby alligator, hold an anaconda and see a guy breathe fire and walk on glass! It was pretty darned cool and they had other performances too as well as live music. It was really fun and worth the money I paid to get in for the event. They seem to put on really good events there! I was really confused at first, too, because I thought Atomic Cowboy was a gay bar--being in the Grove--and whatnot.

187,"I love this spot for so many reasons. First, they serve great coffee. They offer alternative milk options, have gluten free choices for sandwich lunches, potato chips on the side, and even a couple of gluten free muffins and goodies. They were sold out of the chocolate confection I wanted to try, so we had the gluten free, chocolate muffin...which they graciously warmed for us, as well as provided a knife to cut it for sharing. We both had a delicious latte, as well as pressed gluten free, lunch meat sandwiches (around seven bucks each). The sandwiches come with lettuce and tomato. My other half requested no tomato. They goofed, but since he had the gluten free bread, I gladly took his tomato. This shop invests the profits into the local community. They have a spot for refugees to make and sell jewelry, car dangles, cards, and more. Awakenings doesn't charge for the space and doesn't take a dime. It is cash only, as they need to keep the money for the refugees separate from their coffee shop. The world needs more of this compassionate attitude and the world can always use more great coffee. They even roast their own beans! They have plenty of seating and did a great job of visually creating three separate seating areas. Larger groups can gather to drink bean juice of the gods and know their money is helping those who need it. :) There is a small dais, immediately to the left upon entrance. In the back, far right corner...low slung chairs and small sofas converge. The remaining space is filled with tables, coupled with two to six chairs. This shop can be easy to miss, if you are not familiar with what is in the area, as they sit back from the road, in a strip mall (Idaho loves these). They do have plenty of parking.

189,"I have been to Pinewood Social three times now: twice for dinner and drinks, and once for a lunchtime business meeting. Each time, I leave Pinewood in a better mood than when I entered. Why? Because spaces like Pinewood make you happy to be alive, to be so incredibly lucky to be surrounded by beauty and dining on the finest food and libations available, to live in a town that continues to grow and nurture entrepreneurs like the Goldberg brothers, who own this and other equally enjoyable establishments in town. The first visit was the first week it opened, and three friends and I decided to order a variety of dishes to share and sample. Our favorites were the cauliflower salad, the ""things on toast"" (we had one of each), and for entrees, the fried chicken, cheeseburger, and Reuben sandwich. Honestly, everything was great, and we also enjoyed two rounds each of cocktails, as well as after dinner coffee cocktails. The Curtado with Fernet was amazing and I am craving one just thinking of it. My second visit was for lunch, and I ordered the kale caeser with shrimp. It was delicious and a nice portion for lunch. My coworker had the cheeseburger. We enjoyed coffee and remained seated for over two hours, discussing work. The flow from lunch-meeting to meeting-over-coffee was seamless and both of us commented how nice the space was for working. We never felt rushed and were attentively served. The third time was again for dinner and drinks. We order oysters (delicious) and burgers (I was craving the burger since watching my coworker devour his). My friend got cauliflower as her side, and commented to her server that it was overly salted. Our server promptly took it and returned with a new, less seasoned serving. As a veteran of the restaurant industry, this is the type of service that makes me know Pinewood deserves five stars- things go wrong. Nothing is always perfect. Patrons should let their server know if something isn't right. How the server responds shows what level of service is expected at the business. Our server responded exactly how I hoped- she made things right. We couldn't have been happier with our night. I plan to go back for breakfast this week. I have not bowled yet, but the bowling alley looks awesome and is decked out with vintage equipment. In all, Pinewood Social is a step above any other venture in Nashville. Everything is done with the highest taste level without feeling stuffy or pretentious. I would take my grandmother there, a date there, or again, a coworker for a meeting.

The staff has always been nice and accommodating and the courtyard is the best for a romantic South Philly date night. Let's start with drinks - I always get a bottle of Montepulciano or Lambrusco. Both are great. I've ordered cocktails here a few times (typically a Negroni or Old Fashion) and have never been overly impressed, I'd say stick with wine. The Affettati Misti is hands down my favorite appetizer - it's enough for a group of 3 or 4 to share, or the burrata is always a good bet as well. The pasta here is so good I've honestly never bothered to order anything else for an entree. They rotate the menu pretty often but some of my favorites from seasons past are the Summer Pasta (it was sweet corn and zucchini), Hazelnut Gnocchi, and Taccozzelle with Pork Sausage Ragu. Pros: Cute courtyard, yummy homemade pasta, good wine. Cons: Cocktails are just OK, can be a little pricey for the serving size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

The pasta here is so good I've honestly never bothered to order anything else for an entree. They rotate the menu pretty often but some of my favorites from seasons past are the Summer Pasta (it was sweet corn and zucchini), Hazelnut Gnocchi, and Taccozzelle with Pork Sausage Ragu. Pros: Cute courtyard, yummy homemade pasta, good wine. Cons: Cocktails are just OK, can be a little pricey for the serving size."

192,"This place does not disappoint.  It is located in a little bit of a run down area, but don't let that fool you the food here is awesome.  Walking in, its a cute little diner.  Lots of booths and tables and then there is the counter that you can eat at too.  The decor is definitely Reno and Sparks themed.  There are pictures of the different events that happen throughout the year on the booths and also of other nearby local places. We walked in and were quickly seated and brought our drinks.  Looking around at the other people's food, it quickly became obvious that the portions were beyond generous.  With that in mind we decided to split the breakfast enchiladas.  Which were two cheese and chorizo enchiladas with beans, eggs and, hashbrowns. The food came out very quickly after we ordered it.  It was a huge platter of food.  The enchiladas were really good with the sauce and by putting the egg on top of it became even better.  The yolk blended with the enchilada sauce making it decadent.  The hashbrowns were crunchy on top and soft in the middle.  Also with the food came pico de gallo, gaucamole and, sour cream, all of which were a welcome addition.  The service was attentive.  Our server kept coming back to refill coffee and soda and to make sure we had everything that we needed. I will definitely be back to this place to try out different items.  Everything that passed our table looked really good and really well prepared.  The food here was fresh and tasty and totally worth trying out.",,"Reno, Sparks themed, pictures",,"Reno, Sparks themed, pictures",,They are Reno and Sparks themed.

194,"This place is intimate but legit for salsa, bachata, merengue, cha cha cha dancers - beginners to advanced (or those who think they are advanced). I like management and the bartenders, they do their job well. If you have to park do so on the bridge after 10 pm (free/reduced parking) and go to the lesson then (starts late anyway). The instructors are great. Only downside - know that the man or woman you go with may leave with someone else! True story - those who don't know, part of the salsa culture!!

195,"Mercer is a pub style restaurant located right by the Rogers place arena. I ordered the Falafel burger and my friend ordered the Chicken Burger. The reason we ordered was the great deal of ""Freezing your Bill off"" where you get a discount based on the temperature when the order is placed. portions were very reasonable for the price. My friend really enjoyed their meal. I think my meal was a bit too salty and the fries were a bit over cooked. Always happy to support local businesses especially with great deals. However, expanding the menu and improving on the items would be great way to bring me back to Mercer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the following restaurant review, list aspects that are atypical for a restaurant.

Second (take out) visit, I ordered two Tacos, Nachos, Quesadilla and another Burrito.  Wasn't impressed with the nachos or quesadilla (only cheese, scraps of chicken and very salty nachos) The burrito tasted different (same portion size) and it had too much rice inside. The food this time was average at best.  Sorry, I so wanted to love this place.

199,"The food is decent especially since there is no fresh seafood because of the desert we live in. I have ate in twice and both times i experienced two issues: the horrible service ( stop dancing every 10 minutes and serve your guests, trust me you will make more in tips than doing the dumb macarena or cotton eye joe). I mean these dance buffs are so concerned with getting the next dance ready they forget their guests. Issue number 2 is the portions always change. I got the same crab pot and the second time was much less. I complained to the manager ( thank god he doesn't dance) and he gave me an extra crab leg but they are charging more and giving less. Its a shame because seafood is lacking out here and we have to deal with these dancing bafoons and above average food.. Recommend to get the food to go and but check your order just in case a lady gaga song comes on and they do a poker face instead of paying attention. Better off with red lobster i guess..","dancing every 10 minutes, dumb macarena, cotton eye joe",,,"dancing every 10 minutes, dumb macarena, cotton eye joe",The staff dance every 10 minutes.
