Sitting at the bar is an opportunity to gather information from locals not found on line or in tour books. For instance it is prudent to check the weather forecast when traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for ""haboobs"". These are intense dust storms that can slow or stop travel. I\'d never heard of such a thing.Flying V is rated high for food and service, a rating deserved. Upon several recommendations we settled on the rack of ribs for dinner to share, along with local vegetables and Caesar salad. All were delivered in shared portions and were excellent.

I've ordered cocktails here a few times (typically a Negroni or Old Fashion) and have never been overly impressed, I'd say stick with wine. The Affettati Misti is hands down my favorite appetizer - it's enough for a group of 3 or 4 to share, or the burrata is always a good bet as well.

The first time I went, the sushi was good, but the second time, the sushi was gummy and chewy. The nigiri was huge, not the bite sized pieces it should be. The egg roll appetizer was good, but I think that it was more like a rolled crab Rangoon than an egg roll. The dragon balls were tasty on our first visit (breaded and fried jalapeo coins topped with crab and a tasty sauce), but on our second visit...the jalapeos were not really cooked, the breading fell off...and the ribs and seeds hadn't been removed so the jalapeos were just raw and too spicy/hot for me to eat. Ok, now on to the children's menu. I think it is great that they offer one, but the chicken jerky that they tried pass off as chicken strips was just atrocious. It was so thinly sliced that when breaded and fried it became almost inedible. My grandson gnawed on one piece for a few minutes before giving up on it altogether. (We fed him dinner after we left) I'm bummed...I tried to like this place. I even visited it a second time since our first visit was during their first week open.
