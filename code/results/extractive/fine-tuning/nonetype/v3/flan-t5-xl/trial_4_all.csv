Ryan is an efficient and interesting local man who tutored us on our first visit with tips about hikes, and activities to see in Tucson. Sitting at the bar is an opportunity to gather information from locals not found on line or in tour books. For instance it is prudent to check the weather forecast when traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for ""haboobs"". These are intense dust storms that can slow or stop travel. I\'d never heard of such a thing.Flying V is rated high for food and service, a rating deserved. Upon several recommendations we settled on the rack of ribs for dinner to share, along with local vegetables and Caesar salad. All were delivered in shared portions and were excellent.

During my three visits Ryan was manning the bar. A long list of various margarita and cocktails are offered. We enjoyed the Prickley pear and Rojo matgaritas. Ryan is an efficient and interesting local man who tutored us on our first visit with tips about hikes, and activities to see in Tucson. Sitting at the bar is an opportunity to gather information from locals not found on line or in tour books. For instance it is prudent to check the weather forecast when traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for ""haboobs"". These are intense dust storms that can slow or stop travel. I\'d never heard of such a thing.Flying V is rated high for food and service, a rating deserved. Upon several recommendations we settled on the rack of ribs for dinner to share, along with local vegetables and Caesar salad. All were delivered in shared portions and were excellent.
