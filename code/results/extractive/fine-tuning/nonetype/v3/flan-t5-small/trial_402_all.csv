Because I seriously can't think of a better deal that any other bar has to offer. The Yearly Membership goes for $100 and get's you two pretty awesome deal's. First you get your own personalized mug with the name of your choice. But the truly epic reason to get a membership is the fact that from that point forward domestic beers cost you $1, and Imports cost you $2 every single time that you attend. $250 gets you a lifetime membership with the same deal, and your name engraved on a plaque that goes on their wall. Seriously if it wasn't in Bryn Mawr I'd be all over that shit!But beyond that epic deal, Kelly's is your typical neighborhood gastropub that's college friendly.It has a nice wooden decor, friendly staff, and good beer selection that can make for a good time if you roll in with the right people.
