The first time I went, the sushi was good, but the second time, the sushi was gummy and chewy. The nigiri was huge, not the bite sized pieces it should be. The egg roll appetizer was good, but I think that it was more like a rolled crab Rangoon than an egg roll. The dragon balls were tasty on our first visit (breaded and fried jalapeo coins topped with crab and a tasty sauce), but on our second visit...the jalapeos were not really cooked, the breading fell off...and the ribs and seeds hadn't been removed so the jalapeos were just raw and too spicy/hot for me to eat. Ok, now on to the children's menu. I think it is great that they offer one, but the chicken jerky that they tried pass off as chicken strips was just atrocious. It was so thinly sliced that when breaded and fried it became almost inedible. My grandson gnawed on one piece for a few minutes before giving up on it altogether. (We fed him dinner after we left) I'm bummed...I tried to like this place. I even visited it a second time since our first visit was during their first week open. I thought perhaps they just hadn't worked out all the kinks at that point, and perhaps that IS the problem. I'm bummed...I tried to like this place.

Larger groups can gather to drink bean juice of the gods and know their money is helping those who need it. :) There is a small dais, immediately to the left upon entrance. In the back, far right corner...low slung chairs and small sofas converge. The remaining space is filled with tables, coupled with two to six chairs.

What took me by surprise was how cocky my server, especially when he stated that his stuff was better than Starbucks. Now, everyone knows Starbucks is dammnnn good. I never ever trust a person who toots his own horns. So I gave a demand despite of his self assuredness... ""don\'t make my Macchiatto sweet"". Despite his request, he continued to talk this game, made some design in my drink, and then passed it onto me.

Yeah, there's quite a bit of food here... But nothing really here that was a must have. Not even the sushi table, which I usually like at places like this... Not much really looked appetizing. I wound up having some gyoza, pepper chicken, grilled pork, string beans, and cabbage.. Everything I chose was ok..

The food does not disappoint! This is a bistro, bar, fine/casual dining destination and music venue all in one!! It serves upscale contemporary American cuisine in a comfort food kind of way. Atmosphere: Outdoor seating is available and the main dining room features a floating fireplace and hundreds of caricatures of local celebs and regular diners. Very posh and caz (casual) at the same time. If ""The Hills"" was filmed in St. Louis, THIS is where Lauren would go to eat with Lo. Food: DELISH and inventive too! For appetizers, I like their spinach and artichoke dip and bruschetta. I haven\'t tried the crab & mango pizza but maybe I\'ll save that for next time or you can try it for me and let me know how it is! *wink wink wink* For their entrees, I like to switch it up every time I go, but their pork tenderloin has never proven me wrong.

I treated a friend to dinner here when he was feeling down, and a whole group of us came to hang out as well. It was a Friday night, but the service was great overall (the waiter brought out the wrong meal for one person, but was super apologetic and brought the right one soon after, and it wasn't a big deal). We had an excellent time. I had the fried mac & cheese bite appetizer and dark chocolate gelato for a relatively small meal (most portions for entrees here are huge, as you might expect at an Italian restaurant).
